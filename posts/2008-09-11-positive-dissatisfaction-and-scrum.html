to the alternative (read: job hunting trying to find a company that fits you).
When <em>you</em> fit the company things click. Perhaps I&#39;m being a bit presumptuous
with that last sentence, but it&#39;s truly how I feel working at VendAsta. This
feeling is one of the things that has solidified this idea of positive
dissatisfaction in my mind and how it can be a huge benefit to people in any
field of work, but even more so to those in the world of software development.</p>
<p>Our small development team for the MFS (<a href="https://www.myfrontsteps.com">My Front
Steps</a>) project is nearly completed now and I&#39;m
amazed at how well things are coming together. We have a very well rounded team
of developers who all seem to be on the same page about things. Our experiences
are varied and cover a broad spectrum of disciplines which gives great depth to
such a small team. However, I believe the common uniting factor in what is going
to make us such a great development team is the fact that we all realize that we
haven&#39;t <em>arrived</em> in terms of our abilities. We don&#39;t know it all. <em>I</em> certainly
don&#39;t know it all, and I&#39;ll switch to the first person from this point on as I
don&#39;t want to put words in anyone&#39;s mouth.</p>
<p>I define &quot;<em>Positive</em> <em>Dissatisfaction</em>&quot; as a state of mind that reflects an
individuals desire to continually better themselves by coming to the realization
that they cannot be satisfied with the knowledge they have attained at any given
point in time. I feel that in order to truly succeed in the field of software
development that I have to continually admit that there is always a better way
to do things than the way I think things should be done. My goal is to reinvent
myself every day with the knowledge I learn from others, the web, and, more
generally, my life experience.</p>
<p>I believe that Positive Dissatisfaction fits great with the Scrum development
methodology. Short iterations offer a huge opportunity for team members to
improve their development practices and experience the benefits of learning
quickly from one another. The fact that the team is self regulating in terms of
task load, allocation, and followup promotes a great sense of ownership in the
project that reinforces a sense of continual refinement of processes. I
certainly don&#39;t want to be contributing code/resources to the project that was
the result of some half-assed effort. All of these factors help me to keep
myself in a continual state of Positive Dissatisfaction (have I said that enough
yet?) so that I&#39;m attempting to contribute with a 110% effort.</p>
<p>When you fit the company, it really makes you want to contribute that way :)</p>
