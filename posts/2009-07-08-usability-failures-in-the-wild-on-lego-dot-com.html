Trying to order a catalogue on lego.com in 2009 was an exercise in futility.
</aside>

<p>I’ve been doing a lot of reading about usability. It’s made me think a lot about the user experience when I’m designing and developing. It’s also made me think a lot about the user experience when I’m <em>NOT</em> doing anything computer related.</p>
<p>I recently went to the <a href="www.lego.com">Lego</a> website to try and get a catalog sent to my house. I remember reading through these catalogs as a kid and coming up with all sorts of creative things I would be able to do when/if I received a certain set.</p>
<p>Heck, half the fun for me was just looking at what the Lego designers had come up with. So yesterday I wanted to order a catalog for Andy, my 2.5 year old son, as he’s been really enjoying our Lego collection. When I got to the last screen in the slideshow and tried to go back to re-enter my correct age, it wouldn’t let me! It cookied me and I had to clear my cache to be able to re-enter the form information. <strong>Grrr..</strong></p>

Updated for 2021: Here's the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/page/static/catalogue-request">catalog request form</a>, so you don't have to hunt for it.
