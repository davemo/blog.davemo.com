Trying to order a catalogue on lego.com or use a Petro Canada gas pump in 2009 was an exercise in futility.
</aside>

<p>I’ve been doing a lot of reading about usability. It’s made me think a lot about the user experience when I’m designing and developing. It’s also made me think a lot about the user experience when I’m <em>NOT</em> doing anything computer related.</p>
<h2 id="legocom-catalog-request">Lego.com Catalog Request</h2>
<p>I recently went to the <a href="www.lego.com">Lego</a> website to try and get a catalog sent to my house. I remember reading through these catalogs as a kid and coming up with all sorts of creative things I would be able to do when/if I received a certain set.</p>
<aside class="left">
Updated for 2021: Here's the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/page/static/catalogue-request">catalog request form</a>, so you don't have to hunt for it.
</aside>

<p>Heck, half the fun for me was just looking at what the Lego designers had come up with. So yesterday I wanted to order a catalog for Andy, my 2.5 year old son, as he’s been really enjoying our Lego collection. When I got to the last screen in the slideshow and tried to go back to re-enter my correct age, it wouldn’t let me! It cookied me and I had to clear my cache to be able to re-enter the form information. <strong>Grrr..</strong></p>

<h2 id="petro-canada-gas-pumps">Petro Canada Gas Pumps</h2>
<p>I went to fill up my car the other day, and wanted to pay at the pump. There were 2 icons to display the “right” way to insert my debit card… which one was the right one?</p>

<aside>I realize the irony in posting about usability failures when Posterous won't even let me select a single image to display underneath my headings. It wraps them all up into this slideshow. Hey Posterous, if you're listening, how about an interface that allows me to select and insert single images that were uploaded as part of a bundle?</aside>
