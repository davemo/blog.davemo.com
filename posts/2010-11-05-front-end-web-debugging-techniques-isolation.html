My idea of &quot;fun&quot; on a Friday night is to go downstairs
and write a blog post with some of the ideas that have been percolating in my
brain for the last few months. I am disappoint. Oh well, my impending senility
is your benefit! That is of course if you&#39;re into front end web development at
all.</p>
<p>So, I&#39;ve been talking with a few friends lately about this idea of &quot;good habits&quot;
with regards to front end web development and I started stewing on a bunch of
ideas on how I could write about something like that in an effective way. Sorry
to say that this blog post will not be about good habits relating to code but
rather as they relate to debugging front end code. I think the latter is
valuable and you&#39;ll still get a decent idea of some good habits to work with
going forward. Enough rambling, onward!</p>
<p><strong>Isolation, Your First Stop</strong></p>
<p>You&#39;ve just fired up your browser and checked out an existing application from
your repository of choice. You get the app running and go to take a look at the
state of the front end because you have a bug to fix. A nice shiny red bug
sitting there in front of you. Eager to dig in you open
<a href="http://www.getfirebug.com">Firebug</a> / <a href="http://webkit.org/blog/1091/more-web-inspector-updates/">Webkit
Inspector</a> and find
yourself looking at no less than 50 separate CSS files and 40 javascript files.
YIKES!</p>
<p>The bug card you have says some buttons aren&#39;t appearing properly in IE7 and the
latest Chrome. So you dive in with your front end tweaker and start disabling
styles dynamically hoping you can affect some change in the cascade that will
fix the bug live in the browser right there in front of you. Bam! Looks good in
Firefox/Chrome and then you open IE and things go to hell. Sound familiar?</p>
<p>It&#39;s at this point that you should really stop what you&#39;re doing and try to
isolate the problem. I&#39;ve spent more than enough time hacking in this way to
know that it&#39;s a lost cause and infinitely frustrating to boot. The best way to
fix a rendering issue in a case like this is to isolate your problem so you can
control the number of variables you are testing.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s how I like to break down my isolation debugging process:</p>
<p><strong>1. Create a Test Case</strong></p>
<p>Open a new html file in Textmate or your favorite code editor and create a brand
new HTML page. I like to keep a skeleton page so I can do this quickly. This
page should have no stylesheets or scripts loaded.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/davemo/665184.js"></script>

<p><strong>2. Replicate the Environment</strong></p>
<p>Bring the HTML in question into your sample page as it appears in your
production code. Also bring only the CSS that applies to those elements and put
them in a style block in the head of your sample page.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/davemo/665183.js"></script>

<p><strong>3. Verify</strong></p>
<p>You probably have some assumptions about what you think the problem is, this is
the step where you verify that. Open your sample page in the browsers you want
to test in and see what kind of results you get. The goal here is to eliminate
the thousands of lines of other CSS and JavaScript that might be altering the
way your markup is displayed.</p>

<img src="/img/17120050-Screen_shot_2010-11-05_at_10.14.39_PM.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>4. Refactor</strong></p>
<p>Once you&#39;ve verified things are behaving the way you want you should probably
refactor that HTML and CSS to contain less presentation in your markup. Often
markup from legacy applications has been touched by many different people with
varying interpretations about how to write HTML; that&#39;s ok but given you spent
the time to isolate this problem you may as well do some cleanup.</p>
<p><strong>5. Verify ... Again</strong></p>
<p>You&#39;ve made changes, run your test page through the browsers you are testing for
again. Repeat step 4 and 5 until you&#39;ve got a good baseline to work with. It&#39;s
also good to remember the answer to
<a href="http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com">http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com</a> at
this point. :)</p>
<p><strong>6. Integrate</strong></p>
<p>You were able to eliminate a bunch of redundant CSS selectors and redundant
markup. Great! Now it&#39;s time to inject your newly refactored code back into the
mess of 50 CSS and 40 javascript files. This can be challenging based on how
many dependencies you touched in your refactoring but at least you have a
baseline of what to expect now.</p>
<p>Integration is going to result in some more rendering anomalies but now you have
a core set of solid CSS/HTML that you know will work. What you do now is go
through Firebug/Webkit Inspector and start disabling styles in the cascade that
also affect your elements until you get the result you are looking for.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
<p>You will probably still have to fiddle but at least you will have eliminated a
significant amount of frustration by isolating the problem and proving out your
assumptions about how the markup and css will behave in other browsers. Of
course you could avoid a significant amount of this cross browser
troubleshooting by using something like
<a href="http://compass-style.org/docs/">Compass</a> and
<a href="http://brandonmathis.com/blog/2010/09/21/fast-color-theming-with-compass-and-sass/">SASS</a>,
but that&#39;s a topic for another blog post ;)</p>
<p>I hope this was helpful to you and I wish you luck on improving your front end
debugging process and reducing the amount of frustration experienced.</p>
