Technology</a> over 6 months ago (Nov 1, 2010).
At the time, I had no idea what was in store for me; looking back now I think
I&#39;ve hit a new point from which to grow in my career so it seems time to engage
in a retrospective on the last year.</p>
<p><strong>Some History</strong></p>
<p>Prior to working with Pillar I spent just over 2 years working on a number of
projects at <a href="http://www.vendasta.com/">VendAsta Technologies</a>. I grew a lot in
those 2 years but mostly in a technical capacity. Things like continuous
integration, build configuration, and (briefly) unit testing were introduced to
me. It was enlightening to get a taste of the technical goodness offered by
those things but ultimately I felt like there was no one there who could guide
me in the underlying principles that necessitate them. At the same time I was
introduced to many of the core concepts of this thing people in the software
development community call &quot;Agile&quot;. Coming out of VendAsta in 2010 I thought I
knew what Agile was. I thought it was Scrum, XP, TDD, continuous integration and
a whole host of other technical terms.</p>
<p>Looking back at where I&#39;ve come in the last 7 months I don&#39;t think I can say I
know what Agile is even now, because it is an ephemeral thing that seems to be
constantly evolving. What I can say is that I know a lot more about the core of
what&#39;s important in software development: delivering business value and earning
the trust of those you work with.</p>
<p><strong>Trust and Value over Working Software</strong></p>
<p>My first 6 months with Pillar were served working on a client project for
<a href="http://www.gfs.com/en">Gordon Food Services</a> out of Grand Rapids, MI. I worked
remotely for those 6 months out of an office in my basement that
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/littlemrsmosher">Tanys</a> and I built the week before I
started. A brief note on working remotely: it opened my eyes up to a key thing
that&#39;s required to be successful in life; self-discipline. I had my doubts about
how effective I could be remotely but I decided it was worth the challenge and
committed to myself that I would do what it took. Getting up at 7 am to make
standup in the morning (hello, 2 hour time zone difference), pushing myself to
keep lines of communication open, and pouring my heart and soul into building
trust with the client; these are the things I did over those 6 months. And it
paid off. I grew in my technical knowledge but also in my ability to cultivate
good business relationships.</p>
<p>The people at both the client and Pillar have been great, providing much in the
way of the mentoring and leadership around the principles of good software
development that I had craved for such a long time. In 6 months working for GFS
the team I was part of a team that produced software faster, with less defects,
and with more value than any other project I&#39;ve been on. The experience was
energizing and opened my eyes to the power of building trust and constantly
delivering value all while adhering to solid software craftsmanship principles.</p>
<p><strong>Beyond TDD</strong></p>
<p>Prior to joining Pillar I thought I had a pretty good grasp on the technical
concepts surrounding &quot;Agile&quot;. 7 months later my eyes have been opened to how
much more than technicality Agile really is. At its heart, Agile is a way of
thinking that promotes accountability, integrity, quality, and value oriented
thinking. I used to think writing tests was something you did after writing
production code to verify the behaviour you had crafted. Now I understand
that &quot;The fundamental conundrum of software development: I can code fast when I
have a good design but I can&#39;t design until I&#39;ve coded slowly.&quot; (<a href="http://twitoaster.com/kentbeck/the-fundamental-conundrum-of-software-development-i-can-code-fast-when-i-have-a-good-design-but-i-cant-design-until-ive-coded-slowly/">Kent
Beck</a>).</p>
<p>A good design is achieved by thinking out architecture by writing tests first.
I&#39;ve also learned that tests can act as documentation by example, so it&#39;s
important to continually curate test code so that it doesn&#39;t grow stagnant. Most
importantly of all I&#39;ve seen the power of having a codebase with 95%+ test
coverage and how that acts as a safety net to making change. This last point
can&#39;t be overstated; the freedom experienced through red/green/refactor makes
change cheap and development incredibly enjoyable. At the core of my change here
from 7 months ago is a paradigm shift in the way I think about developing: I
don&#39;t feel responsible writing production code until I have a failing test.</p>
<p><strong>The Best Way To Learn</strong></p>
<p>Something I&#39;ve always felt positive about is my ability to teach. I feel I have
the heart of a teacher, which means that I can empathize with people to
understand the pain they feel. (I&#39;ve felt the pain too, which always helps). In
the last 7 months I&#39;ve been devoting myself to studying more effective ways to
promote craftsmanship in front-end development. One of those ways is to teach
more. This has not been easy; front-end development has historically been
treated as a second class citizen. (I could write a whole other blog post about
that alone, but that&#39;s a topic for another time). Breaking down barriers between
front-end and back-end developers requires a certain amount of grace and poise
that I didn&#39;t have 7 months ago. Being able to effectively communicate solid
engineering principles to back-end oriented developers requires empathy,
compassion, and the ability to communicate using language they understand.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve often had to put aside my idealism and promote compromise. I&#39;ve also had to
become humble and admit that sometimes the front-end is not the place where
everything should live. (But I still think there&#39;s a whole lot of logic on the
server that shouldn&#39;t be there. Again, another topic for another post). The
benefit to engaging developers across architectural boundaries and striving to
teach is that I&#39;ve been able to learn a lot. I&#39;ve learned how to effectively
test drive <a href="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/">JavaScript</a> (/hattip
<a href="http://twitter.com/searls">@searls</a>), how to build scalable, object-oriented
CSS/HTML, how to achieve an appropriate <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">separation of
concerns</a> on the front-end, and how
to translate n-tier architecture principles from the server-side to my
client-side code. Being at a company like Pillar has provided a rich environment
in which to grow; it&#39;s something I&#39;m very grateful for.</p>
<p><strong>The Path to Agility</strong></p>
<p>Many of my co-workers attended the
<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23pathtoagility">#pathtoagility</a> conference in
Ohio this week. I wasn&#39;t able to attend but I think it&#39;s fitting to end a post
about my own personal &quot;path to agility&quot; with some forward looking thoughts that
can help you (and me) to continue on that path. Software development is evolving
and changing; set yourself up for success by being willing to evolve and change
right along with it. Agility is more than process or technical solutions; it
involves integrity, accountability and a fundamental paradigm shift in your way
of thinking. Continue to look for ways you can shift your thinking. Be
open-minded. Teaching is a powerful exercise in self examination and growth; try
to spend time teaching those around you, it&#39;s worth the investment.</p>
