It&#39;s made me think a lot about
the user experience when I&#39;m designing and developing. It&#39;s also made me think a
lot about the user experience when I&#39;m <em>NOT</em> doing anything computer related.</p>

<p>I recently went to the <a href="www.lego.com">Lego</a> website to try and get a catalog
sent to my house. I remember reading through these catalogs as a kid and coming
up with all sorts of creative things I would be able to do when/if I received a
certain set. Heck, half the fun for me was just looking at what the Lego
designers had come up with. So yesterday I wanted to order a catalog for Andy,
my 2.5 year old son, as he&#39;s been really enjoying our Lego collection. When I
got to the last screen in the slideshow and tried to go back to re-enter my
correct age, it wouldn&#39;t let me! It cookied me and I had to clear my cache to be
able to re-enter the form information. Grrr..</p>
<p>[Here&#39;s the <a href="http://shop.lego.com/TermsPolicies/request_catalog.asp">catalog request
form</a>, so you don&#39;t have
to hunt for it] :)</p>

<p>I went to fill up my car the other day, and wanted to pay at the pump. There
were 2 icons to display the &quot;right&quot; way to insert my debit card... which one was
the right one?</p>

<p>(As an aside, I realize the irony in posting about usability failures when
Posterous won&#39;t even let me select a single image to display underneath my
headings. It wraps them all up into this slideshow. Hey Posterous, if you&#39;re
listening, how about an interface that allows me to select and insert single
images that were uploaded as part of a bundle?)</p>
