<p>I&#39;ve been doing a lot of reading about usability. It&#39;s made me think a lot about the user experience when I&#39;m designing and developing. It&#39;s also made me think a lot about the user experience when I&#39;m <em>NOT</em> doing anything computer related.</p>

<p>I recently went to the <a href="www.lego.com">Lego</a> website to try and get a catalog sent to my house. I remember reading through these catalogs as a kid and coming
up with all sorts of creative things I would be able to do when/if I received a certain set. Heck, half the fun for me was just looking at what the Lego designers had come up with. So yesterday I wanted to order a catalog for Andy, my 2.5 year old son, as he&#39;s been really enjoying our Lego collection. When I got to the last screen in the slideshow and tried to go back to re-enter my correct age, it wouldn&#39;t let me! It cookied me and I had to clear my cache to be able to re-enter the form information. <strong>Grrr..</strong></p>
<p>[Here&#39;s the <a href="https://shop.lego.com/TermsPolicies/request_catalog.asp">catalog request form</a>, so you don&#39;t have to hunt for it]</p>
