Web design from 2009 seems to have a case of the blues.

<p>Everyone has been submitting reviews of the new <a href="https://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> homepage. Most of them focus on usability or how the brand will be affected with search being front and center. I’d like to forget all that for a moment and strictly focus on the most significant change of all: the addition of over 114% more blue on the new homepage. Yes, that’s right, there’s much more blue in the Twitter brand and I found it interesting to take a look at some of the differences with a few screencaps.</p>
<p>The new homepage does indeed have a new logo and a radically different look than previously and without digging into that too much I’ll just say this: I do like the new look and feel. However, I do have to ask the question: “Why so much more blue?” Does the extra blue help or hinder? Is it too busy or does it help unify things on the page more? What do you think?</p>
<aside>Old site: 7 blues that I could count, New site: 16 blues!</aside>
