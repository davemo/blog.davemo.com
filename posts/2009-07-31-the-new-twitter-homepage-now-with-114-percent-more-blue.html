<a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> homepage. Most of them focus on usability or
how the brand will be affected with search being front and center. I&#39;d like to
forget all that for a moment and strictly focus on the most significant change
of all: the addition of over 114% more blue on the new homepage. Yes, that&#39;s
right, there&#39;s much more blue in the Twitter brand and I found it interesting to
take a look at some of the differences with a few screencaps.</p>
<p>The new homepage does indeed have a new logo and a radically different look than
previously and without digging into that too much I&#39;ll just say this: I do like
the new look and feel. However, I do have to ask the question: &quot;Why so much more
blue?&quot; Does the extra blue help or hinder? Is it too busy or does it help unify
things on the page more? What do you think?</p>
<p>(Old site: 7 blues that I could count, New site: 16 blues!)</p>
