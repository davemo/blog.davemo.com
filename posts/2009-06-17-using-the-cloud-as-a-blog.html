pleasantly intrigued by the interface. Couldn&#39;t have a simpler concept for
publishing personal stuff if you ask me, so I decided to give it a try and see
what it looked like. I&#39;m pretty impressed to be honest, driving content via
email, sms, or any other number of input methods and having it appear
automagically on a website somewhere with panache is a pretty cool idea.</p>
<p>Update: I&#39;ve since dug into the Posterous interface and I&#39;ve been even more
impressed. It was easy to add a DNS record for
<a href="http://www.davemo.com">www.davemo.com</a> in EasyDNS and have it point to this
site in a matter of minutes. Yay :)</p>
<p>Facebook connect integration, auto embedding of media including images, video,
music and the ability to post via so many methods. This just makes blogging as
easy as sending email.</p>
