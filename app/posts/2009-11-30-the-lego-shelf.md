### The Lego Shelf

November 30 2009, 8:58 PM  by David Mosher

My Lego shelf is almost complete. I still have a select few Castle sets I'd like
to pickup (the new stuff, with the orcs and dwarfs) but other than that it's
nearly done. It's been a blast having a new house with enough space for this
kind of stuff. The last 2 weeks I've spent quite a few evenings downstairs with
Andy (our 2.5 year old) building and playing castle games with the sets. He's
enjoying it immensely and I am too. Every day I get home from work and he says
"Daddy! Want to go downstairs and play lego!". I have to try and contain his
excitement while we eat supper, but then after we head down to the basement and
bust out the lego. It's nice to have somebody to play with again :)\
