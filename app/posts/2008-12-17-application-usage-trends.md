### Application Usage Trends

December 17 2008, 4:03 PM  by David Mosher

If I had captured a snapshot of my application usage habits during each year of
the last few years I think I would have discovered something like this:

-   **2005:**(Windows): Photoshop, Fireworks, Dreamweaver, Firefox
-   **2006:** (Windows/Linux): Fireworks, Komodo, Linux Terminal, Notepad,
    PHPMySQL, WAMP, Firefox (+Firebug)
-   **2007:**(Windows/OS X): Fireworks, Notepad, IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio,
    Firefox (+Firebug)
-   **2008:**(OS X): Fireworks, Textmate, OSX Terminal, Firefox (+Firebug)

I've got nothing really insightful about these pseudo-stats, it just kind of
struck me as I was working that I really don't use much of an IDE at all now.
