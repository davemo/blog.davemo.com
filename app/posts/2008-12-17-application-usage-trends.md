<aside class="tldr">
Moving from Designer to Developer has caused a change in my most commonly used tools.
</aside>

If I had captured a snapshot of my application usage habits during each year of the last few years I think I would have discovered something like this:

- **2005:**(Windows): Photoshop, Fireworks, Dreamweaver, Firefox
- **2006:** (Windows/Linux): Fireworks, Komodo, Linux Terminal, Notepad, PHPMySQL, WAMP, Firefox (+Firebug)
- **2007:**(Windows/OS X): Fireworks, Notepad, IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio, Firefox (+Firebug)
- **2008:**(OS X): Fireworks, Textmate, OSX Terminal, Firefox (+Firebug)

I've got nothing really insightful about these pseudo-stats, it just kind of struck me as I was working that I really don't use much of an IDE at all now.
