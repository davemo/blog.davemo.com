Spent some time with the Alesis DM10 Studio kit I rented from Long & McQuade
this past weekend. Didn't do a whole lot of cleanup on the track (there's some
pop and hiss when recording via my X3 Live in Garageband that I can't sort out).
Anyways, this was about 90 minutes of playing around with the drum kit and my
other instruments, here's the full list of tools used:

-   [POD X3 Live](http://line6.com/podx3live/)
-   [Alesis DM10 Studio](http://www.alesis.com/dm10studiokit)
-   [Macbook Air](http://www.apple.com/macbookair/)
-   [Garageband (iLife '11)](http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/)
-   [XLN Audio Addictive
    Drums](http://www.xlnaudio.com/?page=products&p_page=addictivedrums)
-   [Ibanez Soundgear SR300M 4-String
    Bass](http://www.ibanez.com/BassGuitars/model-SR300M)
-   [PRS SE Custom 24 Electric
    Guitar](http://www.prsguitars.com/25thsecustom24/index.html)

Hoping I can get some more time learning how to eliminate some of the pop/hiss
but so far I'm pretty happy with the ability to record demo quality stuff with
this setup :)
