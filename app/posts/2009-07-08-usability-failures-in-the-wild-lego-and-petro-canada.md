I've been doing a lot of reading about usability. It's made me think a lot about the user experience when I'm designing and developing. It's also made me think a lot about the user experience when I'm *NOT* doing anything computer related.

I recently went to the [Lego](www.lego.com) website to try and get a catalog sent to my house. I remember reading through these catalogs as a kid and coming
up with all sorts of creative things I would be able to do when/if I received a certain set. Heck, half the fun for me was just looking at what the Lego designers had come up with. So yesterday I wanted to order a catalog for Andy, my 2.5 year old son, as he's been really enjoying our Lego collection. When I got to the last screen in the slideshow and tried to go back to re-enter my correct age, it wouldn't let me! It cookied me and I had to clear my cache to be able to re-enter the form information. **Grrr..**

[Here's the [catalog request form](https://shop.lego.com/TermsPolicies/request_catalog.asp), so you don't have to hunt for it]
