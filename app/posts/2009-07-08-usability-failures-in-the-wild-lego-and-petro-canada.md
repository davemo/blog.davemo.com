I've been doing a lot of reading about usability. It's made me think a lot about
the user experience when I'm designing and developing. It's also made me think a
lot about the user experience when I'm *NOT* doing anything computer related.

### Lego.com Usability Failure

I recently went to the [Lego](www.lego.com) website to try and get a catalog
sent to my house. I remember reading through these catalogs as a kid and coming
up with all sorts of creative things I would be able to do when/if I received a
certain set. Heck, half the fun for me was just looking at what the Lego
designers had come up with. So yesterday I wanted to order a catalog for Andy,
my 2.5 year old son, as he's been really enjoying our Lego collection. When I
got to the last screen in the slideshow and tried to go back to re-enter my
correct age, it wouldn't let me! It cookied me and I had to clear my cache to be
able to re-enter the form information. Grrr..

[Here's the [catalog request
form](https://shop.lego.com/TermsPolicies/request_catalog.asp), so you don't have
to hunt for it] :)

### Petro Canada Usability Failure

I went to fill up my car the other day, and wanted to pay at the pump. There
were 2 icons to display the "right" way to insert my debit card... which one was
the right one?

(As an aside, I realize the irony in posting about usability failures when
Posterous won't even let me select a single image to display underneath my
headings. It wraps them all up into this slideshow. Hey Posterous, if you're
listening, how about an interface that allows me to select and insert single
images that were uploaded as part of a bundle?)
