### 3 Characteristics of Good Programmers

January 12 2010, 10:35 PM  by David Mosher

A wise man once told me that the best way to get ahead in life is to learn
lessons from the experiences and failures of others. That man was my dad. He
didn't share often with me when I was growing up but when he did I listened
carefully (for the most part..) because what he had to say carried the weight
and experience of someone who had experienced far more in life than I had.
Programming is a lot like learning this way. There are people and companies who
have tried and failed, sometimes miserably, at coming up with solutions to
problems. When compared to other disciplines, I suspect there are more failures
in programming than there are successes. This puts us in a unique position as
developers because it offers us a distinct advantage over other industries; we
have more examples of what not to do ... if we choose to seek them out.

**Passion**

I love programming. It's the only job I've had where I feel energized by solving
problems. Sometimes my solutions suck but I think that's ok because I'm willing
to admit it and strive to improve wherever possible. This is what I believe
constitutes passion as a programmer. Passion is different than zealotry. A
passionate programmer seeks out solutions using the best tools and technologies
he knows at the time with the willingness to admit that any solution at any
given time is never perfect; it's merely the best at that moment in time.
Zealots spend their time evangelizing solutions based on hype or buzz.

Passionate programmers use logic, prototypes and test cases to prove that what
they think works will work. Zealots are always working hard to implement "the
next big thing" in the hopes of scoring a knockout; they're like the blackjack
player who constantly changes up his strategy in an attempt to influence the
outcome of the game. Passionate programmers realize that perfection is
unattainable but they still strive to attain it with care.

**Perfection**

It's been said before, "if we could only use solution [x] problem [y] would go
away completely", "things will be all better if we just do this", "this is
exactly what we need, let's implement it now!" I know that these things get said
because I used to say them (and probably still do from time to time; stop me if
you hear me). The problem with these "silver bullet" solutions is that they
don't exist. The "one size fits all" mentality is the sign of an immature
developer. Perfection is dangerous, however the pursuit of perfection can be an
incredible motivator if it is tempered with pragmatism. Knowing when to
implement a solution that is good enough for the task at hand avoids unnecessary
refactoring and saves time.

Ask your business analyst or company owner what they think about perfection and
the response will likely include the word "risk". Far too often the technical is
all we think about. Our job as passionate programmers is to communicate early
and often with our business owners to understand the business goals of any
potential solution. By considering business goals we mitigate against the risk
of building only the perfect technical solution.

**Perseverance**

I'm not an english major but I think that Shakespeare has some good things to
say about perseverance.

> "To be, or not to be: that is the question:\
> Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer\
> The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,\
> Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,\
> And by opposing end them?"\
> -- *Hamlet*

The answer to the question has to be: to be! Giving up is not an option!
Passionate programmers arm themselves with all of the tools and knowledge they
have in order to face problems. They also surround themselves with like minded
people and thrive on failure. Failure affords us the chance to persevere and
refine our process until we reach a solution that is "good enough".

> "And thus the native hue of resolution\
> Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,\
> And enterprises of great pith and moment\
> With this regard their currents turn awry,\
> And lose the name of action." \
> -- *Hamlet*

Have you resolved in the past to persevere through difficult problems as a
programmer only to find that you get trapped in over thinking how you're going
to solve them? Startups with great ideas fail so often because of this.
Passionate programmers are persistent in identifying this shift in focus that
leads to a cyclical pursuit of perfection which steer's companies off course.

What type of programmer are you? *that* is the question.

    what do you think the word penultimate means?

    David Mosher responded:
    @mark p, thanks for the correction it certainly didn't mean what I thought
    it meant, however what I'm wondering is if you derived anything useful from
    the article itself? I'm all for proper spelling and grammar but this is the
    internet, people make mistakes ;)

    I agree, it also seems that resourcefulness, is a theme that occurs
    throughout your other three. I have found that being able to find
    information about how to do things that I didn't know going in to a project
    is the skill I use most often although the others are required to reach a
    complete solution. Good article.

    @AdamWright, absolutely! Resourcefulness and taking initiative as a
    programmer are two characteristics I believe are very important as well :)

    David Mosher responded:
    @Senthil, I agree. Further, if there are programmers who are not passionate
    about what they are doing I would ask them if they have considered that
    programming might not be the right profession for them :)

    I couldn't agree more. My passion for programming and learning is what keeps
    me going. Things change every day and obviously it's impossible to be
    perfect when it comes to programming, but with the things you learn you can
    always strive for it! I've found that tinkering around with frameworks and
    following other developers in the field has helped me stay in the loop with
    best practices, patterns etc. There are a lot of knowledgeable people in
    this field and we could all learn from each other.

    David Mosher responded:

    @Jordan, Yes there are so many people and resources to be able to learn from
    it's sometimes staggering. Lately I've found I get the most traction at
    learning things from following the right people on Twitter related to what
    I'm interested in (primarily Frontend development with HTML, CSS and
    Javascript but really SASS/HAML and jQuery ;).

    I checked out your blog and see that you're also from Saskatchewan. It's
    nice to have some more fellow Canuck designer/programmers around :)

    Jordan Boesch responded:

    @David Mosher: I've heard of SASS/HAML but haven't gotten my feet wet yet.

    jQuery FTW! Some really good jQuery/JavaScript developers I follow are:
    @jamespadolsey, @paul\_irish, @cowboy, @bennadel and of course the leader of
    the jQuery wolf pack, @jeresig.

    I came across your site while I was searching for web development in
    Saskatoon. I'm planning on moving there because Saskatoon \> Regina, so let
    the job hunt continue!

    David Mosher responded:

    @Jordan: I hang out in the jQuery IRC channel as "davemo" a lot as well and
    have spoken with Paul Irish and John Resig semi-frequently about plugin
    development. If you don't do IRC you should make an account on the Freenode
    servers, there are a lot of devs in the \#jquery channel and many other
    channels (\#css, \#django, \#python, \#wordpress, etc...).

    If you're moving to Saskatoon send me an email or twitter DM about job
    opportunities, I might have something for ya :)
