**Blues Jam** by David Mosher [Listen to
this](../../../audio/2012/04/979734-Blues%20Jam.mp3)

I needed a break from preparing for my [Stir
Trek](http://stirtrek.com/Speaker/Get/78) presentation next week and got a
bluesy riff stuck in my head. 2 hours later here's the rough track result.

Tools used:

- Macbook Air

- Garage Band

- Boss RC-300 Loopstation

- Pod X3 Live

- PRS SE25

- Ibanez Soundgear 5 string Bass

- Yamaha Compass Acoustic
