### Useful Bash Scripting

Kevin Pierce showed me some handy scripting when I was updating some svn stuff.

Basically, this sets up a for loop that's iterating over some directories that I
wanted to move into a sub directory. I hadn't done much bash scripting, but this
is much more efficient than typing out the lines 1 at a time.

Useful! :)
