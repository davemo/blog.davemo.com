### Facebook "Live Feed" vs. "News Feed" Interface is confusing

January 4 2010, 12:23 PM  by David Mosher

I was looking at this as I logged into Facebook earlier and noticed that when
you click on "Live Feed" or "News Feed" it becomes first in the navigation list
bumping the other one over. Does this seem really counter-intuitive to anyone
else? Not to mention that I can't even decide which one I really want to look at
and it doesn't remember my preference. My proposition would be to put this stuff
into fixed tabs that don't "jump around".
