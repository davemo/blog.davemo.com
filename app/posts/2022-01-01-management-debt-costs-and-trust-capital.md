[from the individual, employee perspective]

- [trust capital]

When joining a new startup, you will be heavily scrutinized in the first 90 days, often entering into employment with a structured onboarding plan with milestones at 30, 60, and 90 days.

This front loads your management cost and requires a significant investment on the part of the business. There exists some amount of uncertainty about whether this investment will pay off, and the founder hopes that the vetting process via interviews and reference checks will give a good indication of the quality of the investment -- but there is always some amount of risk that this won't pay dividends. Of the many things that keep founders up at night, I suspect this is up there in the top 3.

So, with this knowledge, what can you do to recognize and mitigate this risk? You can, and should, front load your own investment into something I like to call trust capital.

Think of your working relationship like a bank account. There are deposits and withdrawals, and someone somewhere is keeping a ledger of all the transactions (often mentally, sometimes literally). In the early days of your involvement with a company, you begin with a slight deficit in your bank account, even though the company who hired you obviously values you -- they wouldn't have hired you if they didn't!

The currency of this bank account is trust, and the fact that you begin your employment with that slight deficit means you should be highly aware of what the right way to get out of the red and into the black is. Here are some do's and don'ts:

- You should ask lots of questions and be curious, doing so demonstrates willingness to learn.
- You should take detailed notes during your onboarding experience and reiterate your understanding to multiple people along the way. This shows that you are engaged and actively looking to make sure you are in alignment with what the rest of the organization understands.
- You should not prescribe sweeping changes, doing this adds significantly to your trust deficit.
- You should look for opportunities to improve things and write them down, you can even share them with your manager; be cautious here and consider whether the breadth of the things you are suggesting is reasonable. You might want to capture the notes first and then wait until you have a better understanding of the business' needs.

These are all things you should do _after_ you join, but there is another thing you can do before you join that has the potential to offset your management deficit significantly: write your own onboarding plan.

Consider what was communicated to you during hiring, what things are most important to the company? Where is the company heading? What would be most valuable?

By anticipating these things, you can give yourself a massive infusion of trust capital that can often bring you into the black very quickly. Forecast what you would like to do at 30, 60, and 90 day milestones _and_ what you think the business would want you to do. (aside: this is a great question to ask during interviewing -- What is your onboarding plan? What milestones are you looking for me to hit in the first 3 months?).

Then, when you start on day one, you can have a notes comparing session with your manager to present your plan and see what theirs is. Be careful not to be too prescriptive with this plan; present it humbly and ask to see if it resonates with your manager. There will be things that are great and things that might not be a priority; be willing to adapt to let your manager lead as you explore this plan together; they have more context than you do about what's best for the company.

Doing this significantly reduces your management cost right out of the gate, because you have already done some of the legwork to set both you and your manager up for success.

At this point, you have already accumulated some assets to offset that management debt!

Moving forward from here establishes a solid foundation on which to build. Next, keep your own ledger (mentally, or literally) of transactions in your trust account. Having self awareness about when you make deposits and withdrawals is to your advantage, especially in an age where so many companies are promising open-ended benefits like unlimited vacation. This benefit is often nebulous, but it is also an extremely good indicator of someones self awareness; you shouldn't schedule five weeks of vacation after two weeks on the job -- this will put you into significant debt in a hurry, and as my friend Gord likes to say, is a "career limiting move".

Next, reflect on how you are doing on a monthly or quarterly cadence. This will help you ensure you are making the best investments to earn the most trust and compound interest as you grow in your role at the new company. It will also help you be strategic about when the right time to make that big withdrawal is.

At a startup, these conditions are going to change more frequently than if you are joining an established larger company -- you should understand this going in so that you aren't surprised when priorities change and you need to diversify your investment portfolio.

The bottom line is, think of yourself as a savvy investor, trying to forecast, plan, and react to the market conditions in your new company as you make strategic investments to build up your trust account.
