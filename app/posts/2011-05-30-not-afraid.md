### Not Afraid

May 30 2011, 1:58 PM  by David Mosher

I've been working on a song for a little while, this is a really choppy
incomplete version with some absolutely horrible vocal recording (being sick and
trying to record vox sucks). Still have to tie it all together, but I'm liking
where it's headed so far.
