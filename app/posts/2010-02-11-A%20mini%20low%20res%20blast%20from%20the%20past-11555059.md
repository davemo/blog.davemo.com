### A mini low res blast from the past

February 11 2010, 9:41 PM  by David Mosher

I don't have a scanner, but now I'm wishing I did have one. I've been digging
through my box of memories which has 28 years of school report cards,
assignments, letters, drawings and other stuff from my youth. It's interesting
looking back at all of this stuff, it gives one a lot of perspective :)

Once I get a scanner I'll upload some higher quality, but these lo-res versions
capture a couple of neat memories so far.\
