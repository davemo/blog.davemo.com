### Using the cloud as a blog

June 17 2009, 4:55 PM  by David Mosher

I saw Posterous through the [TweetDeck](http://www.tweetdeck.com) update and was
pleasantly intrigued by the interface. Couldn't have a simpler concept for
publishing personal stuff if you ask me, so I decided to give it a try and see
what it looked like. I'm pretty impressed to be honest, driving content via
email, sms, or any other number of input methods and having it appear
automagically on a website somewhere with panache is a pretty cool idea.

Update: I've since dug into the Posterous interface and I've been even more
impressed. It was easy to add a DNS record for
[www.davemo.com](http://www.davemo.com) in EasyDNS and have it point to this
site in a matter of minutes. Yay :)

Facebook connect integration, auto embedding of media including images, video,
music and the ability to post via so many methods. This just makes blogging as
easy as sending email.
