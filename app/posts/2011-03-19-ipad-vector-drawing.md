### iPad vector drawing

March 19 2011, 5:17 PM  by David Mosher

Andy and I spent about 30 minutes collaborating on this drawing in the Ink Pad
app on my iPad. He was the "creative director". I asked him what to draw and he
said "snowman!". Then nearing completion it was determined the art direction
required an icicle sword and pirate hat to complete the vision. Who am I to
argue with the creative director! :)
