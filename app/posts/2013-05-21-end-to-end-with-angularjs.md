This is an extension of my screencast [Intro to Angular JS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ILQOFAgaXE) that focuses more on intermediate/advanced topics and walks through creating a working web application on top of the Laravel 4 Web Application Framework.

Things you can expect to learn:

* $http
* $rootScope
* taking the [AuthenticationService](https://github.com/davemo/intro-to-angularjs/blob/master/app/js/app.js#L19) we built earlier end-to-end
* creating a FlashService for displaying alerts to users
* access control for client-side routes with $rootScope and $routeProvider
* $httpProvider.responseInterceptors and logging out users automatically if serverside sessions expire
* $routeProvider.resolve property and making view rendering data dependent
* laravel 4 migrations, controllers, models, and authentication
