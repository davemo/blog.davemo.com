I've been meaning to get back into recording some of the billion ideas in my
head into digital format. Mostly so I can move on and maybe use the bits and
pieces of riffs I keep playing over and over, but also cause I eventually want
to get to the point where I can record a few songs playing all the instruments.
(I can play the instruments now, it's just the recording techniques and the
software/hardware I need to get my head around).

I was working on an idea tonight on guitar, laid down 2 tracks with the pretty
spiffy [fourtrack](http://www.sonomawireworks.com/iphone/fourtrack/) app for the
iPhone and then started mulling over what to do next. Ended up talking to
[@darylpierce](http://www.twitter.com/darylpierce) (aka plushdaryl) and he got
me to download the most excellent [reaper](http://www.cockos.com/reaper/) to
test out some of the features. A couple of .ogg files later and he'd laid down a
bass groove and a scratch beat to go with. It's not pretty, but it was fun and I
think it will lead to more experimentation.

I called it "mayerish" cause it reminded me of something John Mayer might write
on guitar :P
