# lineman-blog

Clone this repository to create your own blog with lineman.

Just add markdown posts with an ".md" extension to `app/posts` and when you `lineman run` or `lineman build`, they'll be rendered.

You can, of course, add any Less/CSS or CoffeeScript/JavaScript as you can with any other Lineman application. [See Lineman's documentation](https://github.com/testdouble/lineman).

You can also seamlessly push to heroku, just like any other lineman app. [See details about Heroku & Lineman](https://github.com/testdouble/lineman#heroku)

Once you get up and running, you'll want to start customizing all of the templates found in `app/templates`.
