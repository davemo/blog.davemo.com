      "content_html": "<aside class=\"tldr\">\nSmarts™ aren't your career bottleneck; staying engaged in hard conversations is, especially when the plan isn't yours.\n</aside>\n\n<p>I recently finished reading <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43306206-the-courage-to-be-disliked\">The Courage to Be Disliked</a> and thought it would be a good time to reflect on one of the more painful episodes in my career through the lens of resilience, <a href=\"https://blog.davemo.com/posts/2021-12-21-management-debt-costs-and-trust-capital.html\">trust</a>, and the idea of separation of tasks that the book discusses so effectively.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-website-redesign-that-didnt-ship\">The Website Redesign That Didn’t Ship</h2>\n<p>One of my last projects at <a href=\"https://pulley.com\">Pulley</a> was a full <a href=\"https://new.pulley.com\">website redesign prototype</a>. We had been struggling with the previous design and page sprawl for a while, and I was interested in taking a crack at a fresh vision in collaboration with our design team. Within about a week we had shipped a working prototype that included: a cleaner hero section, scroll-to-reveal animated content, an FAQ and comparison table, a clean pricing page, and a few templates and components intended to make shipping pages faster and more reliable.</p>\n<p>We were experiencing both design and information architecture drift for a while, and it felt like a lot of that was being caused by our reliance on the CMS we were using at the time, Webflow. I could probably write a whole other post about all of the downstream impacts of choosing a WYSIWYG CMS for your marketing website, but this is not that blog post. Suffice it to say, we were dealing with a lack of cohesion in content building blocks, which resulted in many of the pages that were being created hitting that uncanny-valley effect that no founder wants to see on their web presence: off-by-one pixel counts on border radii, slightly varied colors that deviated from the design palette, or the dreaded font styling someone added to place emphasis at just the right place for their one-off marketing page.</p>\n<p>It was a fun project—until it wasn’t. The closer we got to <em>make it real</em>, the fuzzier the ownership became. It was especially fun to work with my preferred publishing stack—Markdown and <a href=\"https://astro.build\">Astro</a>—but a challenge emerged in my efforts to move the ball forward from prototype to production: it wasn’t clear who would decide or own the outcome.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-dreaded-dri\">The Dreaded DRI</h2>\n<p>A week after shipping the prototype we had a company offsite, during which there was a renewed charter and some tweaks to our company values. One of my favorite things about the culture at Pulley was the company values around “default public”, “ship it and iterate”, and “disagree and commit”. At the offsite, a new value landed for us: “stick your neck out.” Have a good idea? Move it forward. We needed people who would make bold bets and take risks with conviction. Heck yes, that was exactly what I needed to hear and I leaned into it pretty hard, hoping to be able to drive the website project forward.</p>\n<p>I ended up making a pitch to leadership to be the DRI (directly responsible individual), and had received a yes, if somewhat reluctantly. This should have been my first clue that alignment on “stick your neck out” hadn’t translated into alignment on <em>who</em> owned the outcome.</p>\n<p>Undeterred (or perhaps more accurately, painfully unaware) I kept moving things forward as best I could, looping in folks from the marketing department as well as our COO at the time to make my strongest pitch for moving off Webflow and into a Markdown-based publishing pipeline. This appeared to be well received, and it felt like I was being appropriately rewarded for having stuck my neck out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"my-misdiagnosis\">My Misdiagnosis</h2>\n<p>A few weeks later, a contractor joined the project; someone our COO had worked with before, and was positioned as someone who would help me get the project over the finish line. At first I was glad to have the help, someone else to brainstorm with, and someone who was in favour of the approach I had selected, with a slight twist; they suggested we use a headless CMS. It started out fine, we collaborated to migrate my prototype over to use the headless CMS and Astro, and then meetings started to have more people involved. The COO began coordinating things and driving, deferring many of the decisions to the contractor. None of this happened with clear communication, no one said who was driving, and ownership started blurring right at the moment when I felt like we had forward momentum.</p>\n<p>This was confusing to me, and I started to ask questions about things in our public channels, hoping to gain clarity about who owned the effort, leaning into our <em>mostly</em> healthy operating mode of “default public” for comms.</p>\n<p>I ended up in a 1:1 with both the CEO and COO (or is that a 2:1?) where some honest feedback came for the first time: “Dave, you’re brilliant, but you’re not resilient, and what we really need are people who are resilient”. I tried to dig into that feedback to better understand it, but I was also struggling with having felt somewhat blindsided by the rapid shift in gears in a process and initiative I was helping drive forward to something being delegated to a contractor.</p>\n<p>I ended up shutting down hard after that—pretty much fulfilling the prophecy from the 1:1 feedback. A month later, I ended up leaving the company.</p>\n<p>In retrospect, the feedback wasn’t really the problem; it was that I couldn’t tell if we were in <em>Disagree &amp; Commit</em> (a plan exists, follow it) or <em>Ship &amp; Iterate</em> (we don’t have a plan, keep narrowing and we’ll decide later), and I didn’t actually ask—I just shut down. Leadership had quietly shifted us into <em>Disagree &amp; Commit</em> on a contractor-led plan, and I was still operating as if we were in <em>Ship &amp; Iterate</em>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"not-my-plan-still-my-job\">Not My Plan, Still My Job</h2>\n<p>One of the most useful lessons from Courage to Be Disliked is that of the separation of tasks. If you haven’t read it, the book is structured as a dialogue between a youth and a philosopher over five nights, exploring many of the themes in Adlerian Psychology—an excerpt on the topic of separating tasks from page 122:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>PHILOSOPHER: One does not intrude on other people’s tasks. That’s all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The conversation in the chapter continues with much more specific examples, but this snippet is enough to illustrate what I think I was missing: a concrete understanding of what my task was in the website redesign project, and perhaps what it began as and how it changed as the situation evolved.</p>\n<p>This has led me to a much more useful habit during introspection or when I sense myself getting frustrated: clearly separating my task from not-my-task. Reflecting on the website project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>My task</em>: propose, prototype, learn, align, and be useful <em>within whatever route is chosen</em>.</li>\n<li><em>Not my task</em>: control final adoption; dictate the plan if a new DRI has been designated; personally resolve every stakeholder tension.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Had I been able to make that separation explicit, I think I would have done two things differently: (1) <em>commit</em> to the contractor-led plan and contribute high-leverage work inside of it, or (2) <em>request</em> a return to iteration mode with a timeboxed v2.0 and explicit decision checkpoints. Instead, I kind of just stayed stuck between modes and felt trapped by constraints.</p>\n<h2 id=\"trust--operating-modes\">Trust &amp; Operating Modes</h2>\n<p>“Disagree &amp; Commit” works when the goal is shared but the route is contested. It requires and rests on trust: I trust the decider’s taste and judgment enough to set aside my preferred route and still give my best efforts. “Ship &amp; Iterate” is different: it assumes we’re still shaping the route, so the job is to <em>show work</em>, gather feedback, and narrow quickly.</p>\n<p>In my case, I had trust in the <em>person</em>: I trusted my CEO’s judgment and sense of what good looked like. But I didn’t have trust in the <em>system</em>: the unclear DRI, the surprising plan change, and the hazy timebox made it challenging to know how to be useful.</p>\n<p>This distinction matters. You can be resilient when the plan is clear but hard—when you know what operating mode you’re in and what’s expected. But ambiguous systems drain resilience differently. Without clarity on operating mode and ownership, even well-intentioned people spin their wheels or shut down.</p>\n<p>These are solvable alignment problems—<em>if</em> you name what mode you are operating in and ask for clarity:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Before we continue, can we confirm our operating mode? Are we in <em>Commit to  Contractor’s Plan</em> or <em>Iterate Toward a Decision</em>? If it’s the former, I’d like to propose 2-3 contributions inside that plan by Friday. If it’s the latter, I’ll work on a few more iterations focusing on hero/information-architecture/templates—also by Friday.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What I like about this is it demonstrates curiosity, seeking to understand, and shows alignment and a bias for action regardless of what operating mode we’re in. Had I done this, I feel like I would have kept myself in the arena a lot longer and been much more resilient to changing dynamics; resisting the temptation to become frustrated over things that simply weren’t my task.</p>\n<p>Maybe you find yourself in a similar position; your organization might be adopting another plan than the one you had in mind. If that’s true, then you have a choice to make about how you show up and engage, and if you want to be seen as someone who is resilient, then you need to have the right mindset going into that potential minefield of career-limiting moves.</p>\n<p>Resilience doesn’t mean silence or shutting down; it means finding how to be <em>useful within constraints</em>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"my-resilience-playbook\">My Resilience Playbook</h2>\n<p>In the time between the website project and now I’ve worked with six other clients and made a return to working at <a href=\"https://testdouble.com/team-directory/dave-mosher\">Test Double</a> as a full time consultant, and I’ve picked up a few tricks along the way that have helped me reframe my typical defensiveness when receiving feedback like I got from my CEO into a positive set of steps that help to keep me in the arena:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Pause</strong> Feeling defensive? Name it, out loud or in your head, or to the other person if trust is high. Give it 30 minutes or so.</li>\n<li><strong>Separate Tasks</strong>. What is mine to own <em>right now</em>? What is not?</li>\n<li><strong>Identify the Operating Mode</strong>. Are we in “Disagree &amp; Commit” or “Ship &amp; Iterate”, or maybe even “Stick Your Neck Out”? Ask explicitly.</li>\n<li><strong>Contribute, don’t Control</strong>. “What is the most useful thing I can contribute within these constraints?”</li>\n<li><strong>Close the Loop</strong>. Propose a timeboxed next step; confirm the owner and timeline.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If it helps, here’s a phrase you might use in such a scenario:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’m hearing X and Y aren’t landing. I’ll regroup and come back with options by Friday EOD. Can you confirm whether we’re committing to Plan A or still in iterate-toward-spec mode? That changes how I’ll structure my next pass.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"staying-in-the-room\">Staying in the Room</h2>\n<p>Reflecting on this honestly has helped me realize that the feedback that led to me quitting has been a pretty effective catalyst for growth; it has helped me distinguish <em>trust in the plan</em> from <em>iteration stamina</em>, separate my tasks from others’, and trade defensiveness for a contribution-within-constraints mindset when I’m not the decision maker.</p>\n<p>As I’ve been considering what is necessary to move further into senior levels of leadership in my career, it seems to me that being the smartest person in the room is much less important than simply just being in the room, especially when the plan isn’t yours.</p>\n<p>At Staff+, brilliance <em>might</em> open doors, but it’s resilience—staying useful and engaged even when the plan isn’t yours—that keeps you in the room and leads to more opportunities to learn and grow. The next time ownership blurs or plans shift, my hope is that you (and I) will know what to ask and how to show up.</p>\n"

      "content_html": "<aside class=\"tldr\">\nAs an employee, you have a management cost that you can reduce by making frequent deposits in your trust bank.\n</aside>\n\n<p>I’ve been reading <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/Hard-Thing-About-Things-Building/dp/0062273205\">The Hard Thing About Hard Things</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bhorowitz\">Ben Horowitz</a>; it’s excellent and you should totally add it to your reading list if you haven’t already. Somewhere about the halfway point, there’s a chapter on the topic of “Management Debt” with some ideas I hadn’t considered before:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Like technical debt, <strong>management debt</strong> is incurred when you make an expedient, short-term management decision with an expensive, long-term consequence. Like technical debt, the trade-off sometimes makes sense, but often does not. More important, if you incur the management debt without accounting for it, then you will eventually go management bankrupt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As a software developer, I’ve become all too familiar with the concept of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt\">technical debt</a>, but this idea of management debt was new to me. Ben is writing from the perspective of the startup founder or business executive, but as I was reading I was struck by the idea that it would be useful to reflect on this cost from the perspective of the employee.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-expensive-are-you\">How Expensive Are You?</h2>\n<p>Say you’re about to join a new company, you’ve gone through the grueling interviews and conversations and finally negotiated an offer that you feel is fair, and so you accept. Congrats! Now you can kick back, relax, and wait until your starting date comes around, you’ve made it!</p>\n<p>Well, that’s something you <em>could</em> do, and definitely something I’ve done in the past, but an older and wiser version of myself now sees this as somewhat of a wasted opportunity to <strong>consider the cost</strong>. No, I’m not talking about the cost of relaxing (which, to be clear, I have nothing against), but more specifically how much <em>you</em> are going to cost your new employer on the day you start.</p>\n<aside class=\"left\">\nYou should also consider the opportunity cost of choosing to relax instead of being proactive.\n</aside>\n\n<p>Oh, you haven’t thought about this before? I hadn’t either, but you can be damn sure any CEO or startup founder worth her salt has likely read Ben’s book <em>and</em> has already thought about the cost and potential management debt that will be incurred by taking you on as an employee.</p>\n<p>Now, the fact that they hired you is a good indicator that they think this is a net positive investment over the long term, so you’ve got that going for you, but what you might not realize is that <em>most</em> employees begin their employment with a slight deficit in their trust account.</p>\n<h2 id=\"trust-capital\">Trust Capital</h2>\n<p>Think of your working relationship like a bank account. There are deposits, withdrawals, and someone somewhere is keeping a ledger of all the transactions (often mentally, sometimes literally). In the early days of your employment you begin with a slight deficit in this bank account, even though the company who hired you obviously values you – they wouldn’t have hired you if they didn’t!</p>\n<aside class=\"right\">Companies typically hedge their bets by including some sort of probationary period, 90 days being the most common timeframe in my experience.</aside>\n\n<p>You need to be onboarded, trained, potentially even certified all of which front loads your management cost and requires a non-trivial investment on the part of the business. There exists some amount of uncertainty about whether this investment will pay off, and the founder hopes that her vetting process and reference checks will give a good indication of the quality of the investment. However, there is always some amount of risk that this won’t pay off.</p>\n<p>Of the many things that keep founders up at night, I suspect this is up there in the top 3.</p>\n<p>The <em>currency</em> of this bank account is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_capital\">trust</a>, and the fact that you begin your employment with that slight deficit means you should be <em>highly aware</em> of the need to move your balance sheet out of the red and into the black.</p>\n<h2 id=\"build-your-own-onboarding-plan\">Build Your Own Onboarding Plan</h2>\n<p>One of the best ways to reduce your initial deficit is to come up with an onboarding plan. Yes, typically this is undertaken by your manager, but by thinking proactively about <em>your</em> version of that plan, you will set yourself up for success.</p>\n<p>Consider what was communicated to you during interviews, what things are most important to the company? Where is the company heading? What would be most valuable? Then, come up with a 90 day plan and partition it into 30 day segments, writing down what you hope to achieve in each of those segments and questions to clarify with your manager. Here’s a few examples of questions that can help shape your plan:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What milestones do <em>you</em> want to hit?</li>\n<li>What milestones does <em>your manager</em> want you to hit?</li>\n<li>How soon do you want to be ramped up on the business domain?</li>\n<li>When should you be able to push code to production?</li>\n<li>When should you meet with the other people on your team?</li>\n<li>What gaps exist in your knowledge of the tech?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The more detail and specificity you can add the better, just remember you need to be flexible as your plan might be less realistic than what your manager has in mind.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sharing-your-plan\">Sharing Your Plan</h2>\n<p>Once you’ve created a plan, you should figure out how you’re going to share it with your manager. You could do it proactively, before your start date, or you might want to wait until your first 1:1 session. Context matters, so use your best judgment.</p>\n<p>Be careful not to be too prescriptive with this plan; present it humbly and ask to see if it resonates with what your manager has outlined. There will be things that are great and things that might be lower in priority; be willing to adapt to let your manager lead as you explore your plan together (they likely have more context than you do about what’s best for the company at this point).</p>\n<p>Lastly, be positive, this is a great opportunity to collaborate!</p>\n<h2 id=\"onboarding-tactics\">Onboarding Tactics</h2>\n<p>Once you’ve begun onboarding, you should start thinking about what to do next. I’ve done this many times over my consulting career, onboarding with clients, and have a few lessons to share. Here are some do’s and dont’s:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>You <strong>should</strong> ask lots of <strong>questions</strong> and <strong>be curious</strong>, doing so demonstrates willingness to learn. (Asking questions as someone new is a superpower; you can see things others might not, and the act of asking the question can uncover improvements).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>You <strong>should</strong> take <strong>detailed notes</strong> during your onboarding experience and reiterate your understanding to multiple people along the way. This shows that you are engaged and actively looking to make sure you are in alignment with what the rest of the organization understands.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>You <strong>should not</strong> prescribe <strong>sweeping changes</strong> right away (or at all), as doing this constitutes a large withdrawal from your trust account.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>You <strong>should</strong> look for <strong>opportunities to improve</strong> things and <strong>write them down</strong>, you can even share them with your manager. (Be cautious here and consider whether your suggestions are reasonable. You might want to capture the notes first and then wait until you have a better understanding of the business’ needs).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>You <strong>should</strong> start <strong>small and surgical</strong> and <em>then</em>, if appropriate, move on to large and technical. (You might have the expertise and skill to make sweeping changes right away, but it’s better to lead into this type of thing slowly with many smaller deposits of trust capital).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>You <strong>should not</strong> make <strong>too many withdrawals</strong> in a short period of time. There’s an ideal ebb and flow to deposit/withdrawal that is unique to your company and you have to discover what it is. (This will also change over time as the company moves through <a href=\"https://spin.atomicobject.com/2018/10/28/predictable-success/\">various stages of growth</a>; be ready to adjust your mental model).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thinking this way significantly reduces your management cost right out of the gate, and will help you accumulate some assets, which can give you a significant infusion of trust capital that can often bring you into the black very quickly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reflect-re-evaluate-reinvest-rinse-repeat\">Reflect, Re-evaluate, Reinvest, Rinse, Repeat</h2>\n<p>Moving forward from here establishes a solid foundation on which to build. At this point it’s a good idea to keep your own ledger (mentally, or literally) of transactions in your trust account. Having self awareness about when you make deposits and withdrawals is to your advantage, especially in an age where so many companies have potentially trust-draining benefits like unlimited vacation.</p>\n<aside>\nUnlimited vacation is a good indicator of someones self awareness; you shouldn't schedule five weeks of vacation after two weeks on the job. Doing this will put you into significant trust debt in a hurry. As my friend Gord likes to say \"that would be a <strong>career limiting move</strong>\".\n</aside>\n\n<p>Next, reflect on how you are doing on a monthly or quarterly cadence. This will help you ensure you are making the best investments to earn the most trust and compound interest as you grow in your role at the new company. It will also help you be strategic about when the right time to make that big withdrawal is.</p>\n<p>At a startup these conditions are going to change more frequently than if you are joining an established larger company – you should understand this going in so that you aren’t surprised when priorities change and you need to diversify your trust investment portfolio.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is, think of yourself as a savvy investor, trying to forecast, plan, and react to the market conditions in your new company as you make strategic investments to build up your trust account. 🚀</p>\n"

So passionate, in fact, that I recently transitioned out of a customer-focused engineering role into one focused on developers, tooling, and infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Now you might be asking yourself, ‘What does DX <em>actually</em> mean?’, and you would be justified in asking – I’ve heard varied interpretations of the term.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeanqasaur\">Jean Yang</a> defines it this way in <a href=\"https://future.a16z.com/the-case-for-developer-experience/\">The Case for Developer Experience</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What I mean by <strong>developer experience</strong> is the sum total of <strong>how</strong> developers interface with their <strong>tools</strong>, end-to-end, day-in and day-out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think that a big part of the “how” there is the concept of <em>feedback loops</em>. Good developer tools provide affordances that reduce cognitive load, surface key information at the right time, but most importantly, good tools prioritize keeping feedback loops <em>fast</em> – and nothing depletes my <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion\">cognitive batteries</a> <em>faster</em> than slow, clunky tools.</p>\n<h2 id=\"building-tools-with-nodejs\">Building Tools with Node.js</h2>\n<p>I first started working with Node around <a href=\"https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/blob/v0.4.0/ChangeLog\">version 0.4</a> in 2011 and at the time I had absolutely no idea how anything worked. I came from a designer-first frontend background and my knowledge of JavaScript was limited to the context of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsg84NtJbmI\">browser</a>.</p>\n<aside class=\"right\">If you're new to systems programming altogether you might enjoy <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/davemo/3c6042086deff4c2fd8a5f16751050d4\" title=\"So, You want to be a Systems Engineer\">this gist</a> I put together with a learning path. Building tools with Node assumes at least some of this knowledge.\n</aside>\n\n<p>Jumping into Node was extremely disorienting for me, up was down and left was right, <code>window</code> was <code>global</code> and there was no <code>XHR</code> or <code>DOM</code>. Writing modules, packages, and command-line tools was all new to me, yet I was intrigued by the potential to leverage my knowledge of JavaScript within the world of tool building and systems programming.</p>\n<p>Around this time I was working with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/searls\">Searls</a>, who created <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KERJkJNV5nI\">Lineman</a> after I shared frustrations with most of the frontend tooling I was using.</p>\n<p>This experience was transformative for me because up until that point the tools I was using were clunky, written in other languages I didn’t know as well, and incredibly slow. Justin’s focus on the DX of Lineman was immediately apparent and the fact that it was written in JavaScript (ok, and a <em>lot</em> of CoffeeScript) made it easy for me to contribute to. It was empowering to have someone listen to my frustrations and translate them into magic on the command-line!</p>\n<p>Since then, I’ve been able to work on some of my own tools, libraries, and plugins while picking up a few tips, tricks, and many opinions along the way. My hope is that sharing my experience will give you the <strong>starting place</strong> I wished for when learning to build tools in Node and lead you to a more enjoyable developer experience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ok-but-how-do-i-start\">Ok, but how do I start?</h2>\n<p>Great question! It’s the same one I had when I was interested in writing command-line tools with Node. The rest of this post will be a guided tutorial that I think will help you get started and answer the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How can I <a href=\"#iterating-locally-using-npm-install-dir\">iterate</a> on a node module locally without publishing to npm?</li>\n<li>How can I test what I’m building in <a href=\"#testing-our-tool-in-another-project\">another project</a>?</li>\n<li>How can I <a href=\"#development-workflow-watch-build--debug\">debug</a> the code while developing?</li>\n<li>How should I <a href=\"#packaging-with-vercelncc-and-npm\">package</a> things?</li>\n</ul>\n<aside>\nKeep in mind, <b>I'm biased!</b> If you're experienced and have done this before there's a good chance my approach will probably differ from yours and that's ok.

One such parallel that has stuck with me over the past 6 months or so is the concept of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_fundamental\">the missing fundamental</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A harmonic sound is said to have a <strong>missing fundamental</strong>, <strong>suppressed fundamental</strong>, or <strong>phantom fundamental</strong> when its overtones suggest a fundamental frequency but the sound lacks a component at the fundamental frequency itself. This very concept of ‘missing fundamental’ being reproduced based on the overtones in the tone has been used to create the illusion of bass in sound systems that are not capable of such bass.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When I first learned about this concept, I couldn’t help but think of how it applied to the work we do as software engineers. In the same way that skilled audio engineers can leverage the concept of the missing fundamental to improve the characteristics of sound, skilled software engineers can use a similar set of skills to improve the performance of applications.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-fundamentals-of-software-performance\">The Fundamentals of Software Performance</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.testdouble.com/authors/ali-ibrahim/\">Ali</a> and I were recently tasked with improving the performance of a legacy codebase that was deployed on Heroku using Node.js, MongoDB, and Angular 1. One of our first steps in evaluating the performance of code is to do an audit of dependencies and configuration; this is a great starting point because it can often lead to simple fixes for performance issues, like updating a database ORM adapter that can query things more efficiently.</p>\n<p>In this case an audit of dependencies didn’t yield much and we had to dive further into configuration on Heroku to really make sense of the performance challenge. Significant discovery number one was that the application was configured using Performance L <a href=\"https://www.heroku.com/dynos\">dynos</a> on Heroku (the most expensive <em>and</em> highest tier available). This seemed strange since it did not appear commensurate with the surface area of the application; its purpose was to sync data using Heroku scheduler to pull from SalesForce into MongoDB.</p>\n<p>One of our first steps was to reduce the dyno size and monitor logs to see if the Performance L size was warranted.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fundamental-1-investigate\">Fundamental #1: Investigate</h2>\n<p>Heroku makes it pretty easy to peek at logs for your app, which is what we started with: <code>heroku logs --tail -a td-client-slow-app</code>. This yielded the following trace:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-shell\">app[web.1]:\napp[web.1]: &lt;--- Last few GCs ---&gt;\napp[web.1]:\napp[web.1]: &lt;--- JS stacktrace ---&gt;\napp[web.1]:\napp[web.1]: ==== JS stack trace ==========\napp[web.1]:\napp[web.1]: 0: ExitFrame [pc: 0x1374fd9]\napp[web.1]: Security context: 0x01f9540008a1 &lt;JSObject&gt;\napp[web.1]: 1: getOwnPropertyNames [0x1f954001251](truncated...)\napp[web.1]: 2: getOwnPropertyDescriptors [0x3dffde9f7229]\n[/app/node_modules/mongoose/lib/helpers/document/compile.js:159]\napp[web.1]:\napp[web.1]: FATAL ERROR: Ineffective mark-compacts\napp[web.1]: near heap limit Allocation failed -\napp[web.1]: JavaScript heap out of memory\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/slug-compiler\">slug</a> for this application was ~74mb, which didn’t seem overly large to warrant running out of memory on the lowest tier dyno Heroku provides. That dyno allocates up to <code>512mb</code> of RAM, so we dug into the code path that led to the above stacktrace to gain some more information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"fundamental-2-profile\">Fundamental #2: Profile</h2>\n<p>Node.js has some pretty decent profiling tools for engineers who want to dive into performance profiling. TD-resident DevOps pro <a href=\"https://blog.testdouble.com/authors/micah-adams/\">Micah</a> showed me that you can add some flags to the <code>node</code> process on startup to influence how V8 manages garbage collection. This is useful if you aren’t getting consistency in your crashes and want to place constraints on the application runtime in order to suss out the source of the memory leak.</p>\n<p><code>node --optimize_for_size --max_old_space_size=460 app.js</code></p>\n<p>Artifically lowering the max heap size below what Heroku provisions for Standard dynos yielded the source of the leak was a method called <code>getUsers</code> which was responsible for querying a list of users and their permissions from MongoDB. Here’s a sample of what that code looked like as we first found it:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-javascript\"><span class=\"hljs-attr\">getUsers</span>: <span

couldn’t help but wonder if there was a more efficient way to query and aggregate this information.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fundamental-3-identify-the-missing-fundamental\">Fundamental #3: Identify the Missing Fundamental</h2>\n<p>Returning to the idea of the missing fundamental, as audio engineers must ask themselves “what can I change about the frequencies in this mix in order to bring things into harmony?” the relevant question for software engineers is very similar: “what does this system need in order to bring harmony to its operation?”. In our case it was also helpful to consider that question in a historical context as “what fundamental were the original developers missing when they built this?”</p>\n<p>In both cases, the answer for this application was <strong>how to query things more efficiently</strong>!</p>\n<p>The <code>getUsers</code> method above was doing two things wrong; querying inefficiently for <em>all</em> the users in the system and then allocating large arrays to partition the data based on permissions. Once we understood the missing fundamental we had a path forward to try and optimize this poorly performing code: we should see if we can query things more efficiently. This is what we came up with using <code>async/await</code> and the MongoDB <a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/aggregation/\">aggregation pipeline</a>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-javascript\"><span class=\"hljs-attr\">getUsers</span>: <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">async</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">req, res</span>) {\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> adminUsers = <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">await</span> <span class=\"hljs-title class_\">User</span>.<span class=\"hljs-title function_\">aggregate</span>([\n    {\n      <span class=\"hljs-attr\">$match</span>: {\n        <span class=\"hljs-attr\">$or</span>: [\n          { <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;permissions.admin.corpUsers&quot;</span> : { <span class=\"hljs-attr\">$eq</span>: <span class=\"hljs-literal\">true</span> }},\n          { <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;permissions.admin.techUsers&quot;</span> : { <span class=\"hljs-attr\">$eq</span>: <span class=\"hljs-literal\">true</span> }},\n          { <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;permissions.admin.formalUsers&quot;</span> : { <span class=\"hljs-attr\">$eq</span>: <span class=\"hljs-literal\">true</span> }},\n          { <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;permissions.admin.searchUser&quot;</span> : { <span class=\"hljs-attr\">$eq</span>: <span class=\"hljs-literal\">true</span> }},\n          { <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;permissions.admin.superAdmin&quot;</span> : { <span class=\"hljs-attr\">$eq</span>: <span class=\"hljs-literal\">true</span> }},\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  ])\n\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> corpUsers = <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">await</span> <span class=\"hljs-title class_\">User</span>.<span class=\"hljs-title function_\">aggregate</span>([\n    {\n      <span class=\"hljs-attr\">$match</span>: {\n        <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;permissions.general.corpUsers&quot;</span> : { <span class=\"hljs-attr\">$eq</span>: <span class=\"hljs-literal\">true</span> }\n      }\n    }\n  ])\n\n  <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// ... etc...</span>\n\n  res.<span class=\"hljs-title function_\">status</span>(<span class=\"hljs-number\">200</span>).<span class=\"hljs-title function_\">json</span>({\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">data</span>: {\n      adminUsers,\n      corpUsers,\n      ...\n    }\n  })\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once we had re-written and tested the query to make sure the output was the same, we re-ran our performance profiling to see what the difference was.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-shell\">PerformanceEntry {\n  name: &#x27;getUsers to res.status(200)&#x27;,\n  entryType: &#x27;measure&#x27;,\n  startTime: 496079.094306,\n  duration: 270.1256\n}\nThe script uses ~ 44.550048828125 MB\n</code></pre>\n<p>Using the Aggregation pipeline had yielded an order of magnitude less memory and CPU usage!

With all this focus on state, transitions, and the benefits that come with structuring our applications like this, I’ve found there is still an area that is often overlooked when it comes to managing state in web applications: <strong>the visual or presentation layer</strong>.</p>\n<p>CSS is incredibly powerful yet frequently misunderstood by most developers, which often leads to derision of the language. I think this is mostly due to a fundamental error in the way web developers manage presentation, often focusing their efforts on conditional logic in templates instead of a more flexible application of state-specific CSS selectors to HTML elements.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xpnmtkjCNng?wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" height=\"417\" width=\"515\"></iframe>\n\n<h2 id=\"a-simple-example\">A Simple Example</h2>\n<p>Let us examine a simple example of a multi-selectable list for a user interface (UI) that a designer may have provided in mockup form for us as web developers to decompose into working code.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/css-the-visual-state-machine/css-mockup.gif\" alt=\"An animation of a multi-selectable list of users in tabular form. Each row has an icon which changes to indicate the selection state, defaulting to a snowman, empty checkbox on hover, and finally checked checkbox when selected.\"></p>\n<p>We can see there are a number of interactions at play, and at first glance these might seem simple enough that we would be tempted to solve the problem without putting much upfront thought into it. However, I think despite the simplicity of the example, there are enough complex states to enumerate that we should spend some time thinking about them before we dive into creating this UI.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>State</th>\n<th>Trigger</th>\n<th>Change</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><em>Selected</em></td>\n<td>Click</td>\n<td>Icon changes to a checkbox</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Unselected</em></td>\n<td>Click</td>\n<td>Icon changes to an empty box</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Hovering, No Selections</em></td>\n<td>Hover</td>\n<td>The snowman icon for the hovered row changes to an empty checkbox to indicate potential for selection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Hovering, 1 or More Selections</em></td>\n<td>Hover</td>\n<td>All unselected row icons remain as empty checkboxes, and a yellow highlight appears on the hovered row</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>1 or more Selections Active</em></td>\n<td>No User Interaction</td>\n<td>All icons change to empty checkboxes to indicate the ability to select multiple rows</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Putting aside <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_design\">interaction design</a> (IxD) and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_accessibility\">accessibility</a> (a11y) concerns for the time being, after enumerating the states that we see here there is a lot to consider when building this UI! How should we manage the states? Should the logic live in our template or in our stylesheets? Let’s take a brief look at the first approach, using an implementation in <a href=\"https://svelte.dev\">Svelte</a>.</p>\n<p>Svelte is a compiler that takes as input one or more <code>.svelte</code> files with <em>regions</em> of functionality based on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS; with that input it produces the minimal amount of DOM API output in JavaScript to achieve the desired result. It’s a different take than something like React, Angular, or Ember, which ship substantial runtimes to the browser that execute application code. If you are interested in learning more I highly recommend watching this excellent talk called <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdNJ3fydeao\">Rethinking Reactivity</a></em> from Rich Harris introducing some of the core ideas. The code in the following examples is intended to be simple enough that you should be able to port the ideas represented to any other framework with minimal effort.</p>\n<h2 id=\"implementation-templates\">Implementation: Templates</h2>\n<p>One of the first places a web developer might start is by crafting the template that represents the UI mockup we received from our designer friend above. This seems like a logical place to start, given we need some way to represent the data in a web browser. Let’s build a template using svelte-infused HTML and see how it looks.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-xml\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">table</span>&gt;</span>\n  {#each users as user}\n  <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">tr</span>&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">td</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">class</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;icon&quot;</span>&gt;</span>\n      {#if user.selected &amp;&amp; hasSelection}\n        {checkedBox}\n      {:else if !user.selected &amp;&amp; hasSelection}\n        {uncheckedBox}\n      {:else}\n        {snowman}\n      {/if}\n    <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">td</span>&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">td</span>&gt;</span>\n      {user.name}\n    <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">td</span>&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">td</span>&gt;</span>\n      {user.email}\n    <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">td</span>&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">tr</span>&gt;</span>\n  {/each}\n<span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">table</span>&gt;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Aside from the svelte-specific things like the <code>{#each}</code> and <code>{#if}</code> blocks, this is probably close to what you might implement in any front-end or server-side templating solution.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We’ve taken the list of potential states that we extracted from the mockup above and encoded them as conditional logic in our templates in order to achieve the desired result. The one special case we needed to account for was the non-interactive state “1 or more Selections Active”; to do this we defined a local variable in our JavaScript region called <code>hasSelection</code> which is defined using Sveltes <a href=\"https://svelte.dev/tutorial/reactive-declarations\">reactive declarations</a> as</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-javascript\"><span class=\"hljs-attr\">$</span>: hasSelection = users.<span class=\"hljs-title function_\">some</span>(<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-params\">u</span> =&gt;</span> u.<span class=\"hljs-property\">selected</span>)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Although the code above satisfies <em>most</em> of the user experience (UX) as detailed in the mockup, there are two problems that shake out of an implementation like this that focuses on conditional logic in templates:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We didn’t capture <em>all</em> of the states enumerated, as we cannot effectively translate a user’s <code>hover</code> action in templates alone unless we get really creative and complex</li>\n<li>This paradigm scales <em>very poorly</em> as our templates grow, mixing concerns of <code>presentation</code> and <code>data</code> in a template, resulting in code that is much harder to read and maintain over the life of a project</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The scalability concern is the more worrisome of the two, yet is a common byproduct of developers using conditional logic in templates. Increasingly thorny conditionals can lead to missed acceptance criteria, which in turn can lead to stress and tension on a team. Rather than throw blame around, it’s worth focusing on whether that approach is healthy for a long-term project.</p>\n<p>I think we can do better if we shift our focus from conditional logic in templates to thinking more in terms of leveraging CSS as the language we use to define the states in our presentational state machine and using JavaScript to manage when to apply those states. Let’s see what that looks like as we refactor the above example.</p>\n<h2 id=\"implementation-stylesheets\">Implementation: Stylesheets</h2>\n<p>One of the first considerations we’ll need to make is how to address both the concerns raised in the previous section. We need to handle the <code>hover</code> state properly, and we also should strive for a solution that encodes data in the template and presentation in the stylesheets. Let’s start by refactoring the template to eliminate the conditional logic:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-xml\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">table</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">class:hasSelection</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;{hasSelection}&quot;</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">class</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;selectable&quot;</span>&gt;</span>\n  {#each users as user}\n  <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">tr</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">class:selected</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;{user.selected}&quot;</span>&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">td</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">class</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;icon&quot;</span>&gt;</span><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">td</span>&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">td</span>&gt;</span>\n      {user.name}\n    <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">td</span>&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">td</span>&gt;</span>\n      {user.email}\n    <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">td</span>&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">tr</span>&gt;</span>\n  {/each}\n<span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">table</span>&gt;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>The first thing you might notice is that we removed the conditional blocks replaced them with <a href=\"https://svelte.dev/docs#class_name\">svelte’s class element directive</a>. This is an elegant way to control toggling of a CSS class on an element via a boolean value, which we previously defined as <code>{user.selected}</code> and <code>{hasSelection}</code>. We also added a <code>class=selectable</code> to the root table element in order to allow us to better manage the complexity of the conditional logic for states in CSS. Let’s defer looking at the JavaScript that defines those values and instead look at what the definition of each state in our presentational state machine looks like when we encode it with CSS:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-css\"><span class=\"hljs-comment\">/*\n  CSS variables in conjunction with escaped unicode or html\n  entities are a great way to represent things like icons\n*/</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-selector-pseudo\">:root</span> {\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">--unchecked-box</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;\\02610&quot;</span>;\n  <span

class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;\\02603&quot;</span>;\n}\n\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">/*\n  Managing the hover states to show a yellow background\n*/</span>\n<span

      "content_html": "<aside class=\"tldr\">\n<a href=\"https://github.com/testdouble/dependable\">Dependable</a> is a dependency injection framework for Node.js\n</aside>\n\n<p>Recently, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Schoonology\">Michael Schoonmaker</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/primarilysnark\">Joshua Starkey</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dmosher\">myself</a> got together to brainstorm some improvements we wanted to make to an open source library called Dependable that we had used on a client project.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/testdouble/dependable\">Dependable</a> is billed as “A minimalist dependency injection framework for node.js”, but I feel like it only took on the “minimalist” moniker after we shipped version 2.0 just a few weeks ago. As we sat down to discuss what we wanted to do there were a number of questions that shook out that I feel need to be asked by any team working on an open source project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How can we make this smaller?</li>\n<li>What features are core and what can we prune?</li>\n<li>How can we write the test-suite in a way that demonstrates real-world examples?</li>\n<li>What should the README communicate?</li>\n<li>How are we going to maintain this going forward?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As we worked towards the backlog of features, we built up a list of <em>nice-to-haves</em> and <em>must-haves</em>, choosing to defer the former and focus our efforts on the latter. <a href=\"https://github.com/testdouble/dependable/projects/1\">Github Projects</a> actually worked pretty well for a lightweight project management tool.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/open-source-spotlight-dependable-js/github-projects-dependable.png\" alt=\"Github Projects\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"limiting-api-surface-area\">Limiting API Surface Area</h2>\n<p>One of our stated goals was to reduce the surface area of dependable in order to eliminate complexity in the codebase. The 1.0 release of dependable included a public API with 6 methods on the dependency inversion <code>container</code> and our rewrite whittled this down to 4. Choosing to have this discussion early allowed us to focus on what the most valuable parts of the API were, using our experience of real-world use within consulting projects to help guide us.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>1.0 Public API</th>\n<th>2.0 Public API</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>container.register(name, func)</code></td>\n<td><code>container.factory(name, func)</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>container.register(hash)</code></td>\n<td><code>container.constant(name, object)</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>container.load(fileOrFolder)</code></td>\n<td>removed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>container.get(name, overrides = {})</code></td>\n<td><code>container.get(name, overrides = {})</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>container.resolve(overrides={}, cb)</code></td>\n<td>removed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>container.list()</code></td>\n<td>removed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>non-existent</td>\n<td><code>container.getSandboxed(name, overrides={})</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>With the API sufficiently whittled down, we also set ourselves to renaming the methods in the public API in order to better reveal the intent for each method and avoid violating <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle\">SRP</a> (which some of the 1.0 API methods had done via overloading). <code>container.register(hash)</code> became <code>container.constant(name, object)</code>, and <code>container.register</code> was renamed simply to <code>container.factory</code>. We deliberated for a while over naming but felt that <code>.factory</code> and <code>.constant</code> were terms that were familiar enough in the context of dependency injection and more descriptive than their 1.0 counterparts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"rewriting-source-and-test\">Rewriting Source and Test</h2>\n<p>Dependable 1.0 was written in CoffeeScript which we felt would limit options for potential future contributors. We chose to rewrite the library in ES6 and use <a href=\"https://standardjs.com/\">standard</a> to manage formatting the code for us. It becomes much easier for future contributors to submit patches when the tooling in an open source project handles formatting of the code.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>1.0 LOC (index.coffee)</th>\n<th>2.0 LOC (index.js)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>134</td>\n<td>99</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The test-suite took slightly longer to rewrite due to the removal of <code>container.load(fileOrFolder)</code>. We felt that this method complected the 1.0 codebase and was syntactic sugar for what could be accomplished by a user via loading one or many files externally using <code>require</code> or <code>import</code> and then invoking <code>container.factory(name, func)</code> within the context of a call to <code>.map</code>. In addition to translating the <code>.coffee</code> test sources to <code>.js</code>, we also reorganized the test examples themselves to better communicate the intended use of dependable.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>1.0 Test LOC (multiple .coffee files)</th>\n<th>2.0 Test LOC (test.js)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>~380</td>\n<td>259</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>A consistent use of objects from a real world scenario involving a <code>Logger</code>, <code>Router</code>, and <code>Formatter</code> in the context of an <code>App</code> was used throughout the test-suite. I’ve found that I’m much more likely to contribute to open source projects that have a well architected test suite with meaningful examples.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-javascript\"><span class=\"hljs-title function_\">it</span>(<span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;should register a factory with a single dependency&#x27;</span>, <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> (<span class=\"hljs-params\"></span>) {\n  subject.<span class=\"hljs-title function_\">factory</span>(<span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;logger&#x27;</span>, <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> (<span class=\"hljs-params\"></span>) {\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;message&#x27;</span>\n  })\n  subject.<span class=\"hljs-title function_\">factory</span>(<span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;app&#x27;</span>, <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> (<span class=\"hljs-params\">logger</span>) {\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> logger\n  })\n  assert.<span class=\"hljs-title function_\">equal</span>(subject.<span class=\"hljs-title function_\">get</span>(<span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;app&#x27;</span>), <span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;message&#x27;</span>)\n})\n</code></pre>\n<p>In addition, we added first-class support for isolation testing via <code>container.getSandboxed</code> which should be used during testing to ensure that a module under test has been completely isolated.</p>\n<h2 id=\"closing-thoughts--recommended-reading\">Closing Thoughts &amp; Recommended Reading</h2>\n<p>At Test Double we are proud of our commitment to open source and we take pride in trying to be thoughtful in the way we approach open source stewardship.

If any of these statements resonates with you then you’ve most likely been in the shoes of the person making the statement <em>or</em> as a consultant engaged with a client in a similar predicament. The phrase “Software Consulting” generally evokes feelings of <strong>praise</strong> or <strong>disdain</strong>, or perhaps both depending on the circumstances. As consultants, we are often positioned as experts and typically engaged during times of crisis or uncertainty; so it should come as no surprise that our ability to deliver in the midst of that environment is the primary measure of our effectiveness.</p>\n<p>Expectations about what we are hired to deliver generally set the scale by which we are judged; frequently that involves analysis, reporting, recommendations but also training, mentoring, and code. The world is a big enough place that it’s plausible to think of a scenario where the opening statements above were made by someone dealing with the aftermath of a poor experience with a previous software consultancy, typically measured by the state or quality of “the code”.</p>\n<p>While it would be interesting to attempt an objective look at what typifies “quality” as it relates to “code”, I think there is a <em>more</em> interesting vector to approach the quality valuation that also pertains to “code” of a different kind; call it the code of conduct, or the way we interact with our clients as consultants, or perhaps even our ability to relate and help them rise out of the midst of chaos and uncertainty&mdash;this type of consultant’s code is less frequently explored, which is a shame, because I firmly believe it has a more direct impact on the physical code we write than our technical expertise.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hostile-takeover\">Hostile Takeover</h2>\n<p>Consultants in any industry are often vilified from the start of an engagement due to a perceived “us vs them” mentality. Depending on the how the engagement was initiated, trust was likely extended from key decision makers but generally does <em>not</em> extend from the rank and file employees of the company. This puts an immediate burden of responsibility on the consultant to become adept at earning that trust inclusively and at discerning barriers which would prevent that from happening.</p>\n<p>The key to building this trust starts with establishing relationships with <em>everyone</em> on the team. It might be easy to think of ourselves as only accountable to the primary stakeholders, but unless we earn the trust of our peers and treat them as equals, it will be challenging to avoid the perception of a hostile takeover. In essence we should think of ourselves as partners, invested in the success of the company and each member of the team. Finding opportunities to mentor team members and attribute wins to others is a great way foster a positive consulting environment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cooperation--commiseration\">Cooperation &amp; Commiseration</h2>\n<p>At some point any consulting engagement will involve hearing about the technical failures, company problems, personnel issues, and every other negative thing under the sun; people like to complain. Good consultants know how to view these conversations as opportunities to build trust without becoming embroiled in corporate politics. It is a balancing act to be able to participate in just enough commiseration to demonstrate understanding without fostering a negative cycle. I believe a critical component to developing this skill is the ability to hone one’s capacity for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_listening\">active listening</a>.</p>\n<p>There is a fine line between commiserating and ruminating, and good consultants know how to empathize and then steer the conversation towards solutions instead of ruminating on past failures.</p>\n<h2 id=\"technical-overdrive\">Technical Overdrive</h2>\n<p>Depending on the nature of the team and the consulting engagement, it may prove more effective to lead by example and jump into what I like to call “technical overdrive”. I’ve seen many teams become derailed in endless technical round-table discussions and talk themselves into a corner before ever trying to code up a prototype or draft solution. In these scenarios I have found it best to move forward with quick prototypes of solutions proposed by the team, enabling them to have more concrete discussion points and base decisions on actual implementations. Working code and a good demo can unblock many teams.</p>\n<p>Like every piece of advice, when to jump into technical overdrive is highly context-sensitive; sometimes it is more appropriate to employ the opposite strategy and slow things down. Some teams have a bad habit of shipping their prototypes to production, and it is in this scenario where good consultants will try and introduce better habits around technical design, architecture discussions and how to effectively prototype. In some ways the slow-things-down scenario also involves technical overdrive, as it might mean taking the lead on demonstrating what these good habits look like for the team.</p>\n<h2 id=\"closing-thoughts--recommended-reading\">Closing Thoughts &amp; Recommended Reading</h2>\n<p>As a consultant, building trust should be our number one goal, but we have to remember that it takes time and is a skill that needs to be cultivated over the course of many engagements.

In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war.</p>\n<p>Meh. War is tiresome and I have had enough of war. This post is about some small usability improvements you can add to your Makefiles if you are using Make. Let’s dig in!</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-makefile\">The Makefile</h2>\n<p>Make has been around for a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)\">long time</a>. It has some neat features but it’s not always the friendliest to neophytes. Imagine you have a new developer joining your team, and your project has a Makefile that looks something like this</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-Makefile\">VERSION ?= <span class=\"hljs-variable\">$(<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">shell</span> cat VERSION)</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-meta\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">.PHONY</span>: version clean bump release</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-section\">build:</span>\n  @echo <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;building...&quot;</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># build the app here</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-section\">clean:</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># rm -rf build</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-section\">release:</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># bump</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># make push -e VERSION=$(shell cat VERSION)</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-section\">push:</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># push the build artifact at a given version somewhere</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-section\">version:</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># cat VERSION</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-section\">bump:</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># using semver, bump the version by a major, minor or patch increment</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>At first glance this Makefile isn’t all that complicated but chances are your build automation process is composed of many more lines of code or even split into multiple places. The wise aged veteran developer on your team tells the new member “to build this project just clone this repo and run <code>make</code>“ after which the new developer sees</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-shell\">neophyte@newbie:~/code/project\n<span class=\"hljs-meta\">$ </span><span class=\"language-bash\">make</span>\nbuilding...\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, assuming new dev didn’t encounter any snags with project setup and installing dependencies (hah! unlikely) this still doesn’t present a great picture of how the project is assembled or the bits of the lifecycle that are involved at first glance. Let’s see if we can improve this initial Makefile developer experience.</p>\n<h3 id=\"step-1-add-a-default_goal\">Step 1: Add a DEFAULT_GOAL</h3>\n<p>In Make semantics, <em>goals</em> are targets that <code>make</code> should strive to update. The docs give us a nice <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Goals.html\">explanation of goals</a> as well as some hints about how we can manage which goal is run first</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>By default, the goal is the first target in the makefile (not counting targets that start with a period). Therefore, makefiles are usually written so that the first target is for compiling the entire program or programs they describe. If the first rule in the makefile has several targets, only the first target in the rule becomes the default goal, not the whole list. You can manage the selection of the default goal from within your makefile using the .DEFAULT_GOAL variable (see <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Special-Variables.html#Special-Variables\">Other Special Variables</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even though the docs give us some informal conventions about the first target in our Makefile I think it <em>makes</em> (heh) for a better experience if we add some sort of help target that spits out some information to the terminal. Make doesn’t have any facility to display help messages like some <a href=\"https://rake.rubyforge.org/Rake/Application.html\">other build automation tools</a>, but it won’t be too hard to add one. First, let’s add a default goal of help</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-Makefile\">.DEFAULT_GOAL := help\n\n<span class=\"hljs-section\">help:</span>\n  @echo <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;Welcome to the Project!&quot;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<caption>\n  <strong>Tip:</strong> prefixing a line in your make target with `@` suppresses output of that line to stdout.\n</caption>\n\n<p>With this in place our new developer sees the following</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-shell\">neophyte@newbie:~/code/project\n<span class=\"hljs-meta\">$ </span><span class=\"language-bash\">make</span>\nWelcome to the Project!\n</code></pre>\n<p>Ok, this is a little more friendly but still not very useful. We can do better!</p>\n<h3 id=\"step-2-annotate-makefile-targets\">Step 2: Annotate Makefile Targets</h3>\n<p>Let’s update our Makefile to add helpful annotations to <em>some</em> of our targets using comment blocks prefixed with <code>##</code></p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-Makefile\"><span class=\"hljs-section\">build: ## builds the application</span>\n  @echo <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;building...&quot;</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-section\">clean: ## gets you back to a clean working state</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># rm -rf build</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-section\">release: bump ## bump the VERSION file, git tags, and push to github</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># make push -e VERSION=$(shell cat VERSION)</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>This annotation scheme works pretty well but doesn’t buy us anything on its own, to make this truly useful we need to parse the Makefile, look for lines prefixed with <code>##</code> and format them in a pretty way and write them to <code>stdout</code></p>\n<h3 id=\"step-3-parse-annotations\">Step 3: Parse Annotations</h3>\n<p>Make includes a handy <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Special-Variables.html#Special-Variables\">list of special variables</a> that can be used for all sorts of handy things. In this case we can use the <code>MAKEFILE_LIST</code> variable along with <code>grep</code>, <code>sort</code> and <code>awk</code> to get a list of annotated targets and display them on <code>stdout</code> in a user-friendly way</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-Makefile\"><span class=\"hljs-section\">help:</span>\n  @grep -E &#x27;^[a-zA-Z_-]+:.*?<span class=\"hljs-comment\">## .*$$&#x27; $(MAKEFILE_LIST) | sort | awk &#x27;BEGIN {FS = &quot;:.*?## &quot;}; {printf &quot;\\033[36m%-30s\\033[0m %s\\n&quot;, $$1, $$2}&#x27;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wondering what the <code>help</code> target is doing? See this <a href=\"https://explainshell.com/explain?cmd=grep+-E+%27%5E%5Ba-zA-Z_-%5D%2B%3A.*%3F%23%23+.*%24%24%27+%24%28MAKEFILE_LIST%29+%7C+sort+%7C+awk+%27BEGIN+%7BFS+%3D+%22%3A.*%3F%23%23+%22%7D%3B+%7Bprintf+%22%5C033%5B36m%25-30s%5C033%5B0m+%25s%5Cn%22%2C+%24%241%2C+%24%242%7D%27\">explain shell</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With that in place our new developer would run <code>make</code> from the command-line and see</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-shell\">neophyte@newbie:~/code/project\n<span class=\"hljs-meta\">$ </span><span class=\"language-bash\">make</span>\nbuild           builds the application\nclean           gets you back to a clean working state\nrelease         bump the VERSION file, git tags, and push to github\n</code></pre>\n<p>Yay! This is a much nicer developer-experience than what we started with. To take it even further I might suggest annotating only a subset of tasks that are most commonly used.</p>\n<h2 id=\"acknowledgements--links\">Acknowledgements / Links</h2>\n<p>There are a few sources that come up when you google for “self-documenting makefile” along with a few different ways of solving this problem. I drew inspiration for this post mostly from <a href=\"https://marmelab.com/blog/2016/02/29/auto-documented-makefile.html\">this marmelab entry</a>, but felt like there were enough interesting points and general make tips added that it was worth another post.</p>\n<p>Other links you may find useful:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/davemo/c0462e8196289e0fb0210ee63ff02962\">Full Makefile as Gist</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/davemo/88de90577a57698dd72d722bcfc44964\">VERSION bump script as Gist</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/\">GNU Make</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cmcrossroads.com/print/article/self-documenting-makefiles\">Self Documenting Makefiles</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://explainshell.com\">Explain Shell</a></li>\n</ul>\n"

      "content_html": "<aside class=\"tldr\">\nThink hard before you quit your job. Consider whether you might be quitting to chase technology, scale, or to run from adversity.\n</aside>\n\n<p>2016 was a year of ups and (if you agree with many of the social media channels in the last month) a significantly larger number of downs. I’m not sure  <em>exactly</em> what it is about this time of year that causes us to reflect so much more than the rest of the year; I suspect it <em>mostly</em> has to do with a heightened sense of awareness as we approach boundaries.</p>\n<p>As children, we know they are there because our parents tell us and we frequently come close to them often by virtue of desiring to push past to see what is beyond. As parents, we know they are there because we create them; often intending to protect our children from things that are dangerous or to set parameters for healthy  age-appropriate interaction. As software developers we encounter <a href=\"https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries\">boundaries</a> in tests, the design of our code as it relates to components in a system, API’s, the list goes on and on. Being in constant consideration of boundaries, whether consciously or subconsciously, has the side-effect of switching our brain into analysis and reflection mode.</p>\n<p>I recently had some friends reach out for advice as they were contemplating a transition at a critical boundary: quitting their job.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s time for a change</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’ve been restless but I’m trying to be cautious</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These exchanges, coupled with the time of year and my brain switching into reflection mode, have had me considering reasons I left jobs in the past. The more I thought about it the more my brain kept telling me that those reasons were often <em>not</em> valid reasons to justify leaving. I wrestled with it and tried to move onto other thoughts but it just kept nagging at me; this is usually an indication I need to deal with those thoughts in a positive way. So, here I am attempting to impart some wisdom about reasons <em>not</em> to quit your job in 2017 (but mostly just typing as an exercise to free my brain up to move onto other things!) 😉</p>\n<h2 id=\"technology\">Technology</h2>\n<p>On April 3rd, 2014 I wrote <a href=\"https://blog.davemo.com/posts/2014-04-03-the-magnetic-core-philosophy.html\">some of the reasons</a> I left the last job I was at. I’ve re-read that post a dozen times trying to mine some fragments of wisdom, mostly to attempt to justify the decisions at that time. The only conclusions I’ve come up with at this point are: there are a lot of emotions in my writing that stemmed <em>mainly</em> from too much focus on Technology as one of the reasons I quit.</p>\n<p>Technology is seductive; it attempts to woo us through flashy demos from paid evangelists or conference talks from influential heroes. Technology is like the trench-coat wearing crook on the street corner who promises us the Rolex and ends up delivering a cheap imitation. When the tech-stack you work with (or <em>want</em> to work with) becomes the justification for a career change it has the potential to snowball into a full on addiction to newness that sets your brain up for a dependence on switching tech in the same way a drug addict depends on their narcotic of choice.</p>\n<p>The truth is that most systems that we work on move slowly towards <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_entropy\">disorder and complexity</a>, so it is no surprise that the promise of a fresh-start in a new technology stack is appealing. An entire generation of software developers have become so accustomed to quitting their job based on technology that I suspect the coming decades will yield a significant need for people who have experience dealing with systems over a long period of time. If we don’t deal with our addiction to newness, the recruiter pitch of “Junior Developer Wanted, 5 years experience Node.JS/Rails/…” that we so frequently deride will turn into “Senior Developer Wanted, 10 years experience dealing with software entropy” and there will be no one to answer the call.</p>\n<p>Don’t get sucked into the new tech cycle; learn to embrace what you’re working on now and strive to work the best with the technology constraints you’ve been handed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"scale\">Scale</h2>\n<p>So, you’ve thought considerably about your current job and ruled out technology as the main reason for leaving. In fact, you’re sticking with the tried and true tech-stack you’ve always known, but there’s just been that nagging feeling that you’d be so much better off if you could experience working with your stack at a larger scale. Oh to be able to understand the constraints of systems at an order-of-magnitude or two beyond where you are working now; that’s the ticket!</p>\n<p>Scale is subtle; on the surface it promises a similar thing to the tech-stack switch: an opportunity to learn new things that your current scale of operations can’t teach you. Chances are you will probably actually learn some new technical things by increasing scale; the reality is that we tend to focus more on the <em>technical</em> and less on the <em>human</em> side of software development which often affects increases in scale much more. In his book, <a href=\"https://www.predictablesuccess.com/books/predictable-success/\">Predictable Success</a>, Les McKeown gives some wisdom about how scale affects success in an operation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Predictable Success is defined as one of the seven stages of organizational development. It can be attained by any organization or group that acts as a human machine, well-oiled, working in concert, not without challenge, but focused and “in the zone” where growth is attainable <em>and</em> sustainable. It is not about size or the age of an organization. It has nothing to do with resources, culture or industry.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"/img/reasons-not-to-quit-your-job/predictable.success.whole.picture.png\" alt=\"The Whole Picture of Organizational Development according to Predicable Success\"></p>\n<p>I particularly like his focus on the “human” factors and exclusion of the traditionally technical things we tend to focus on. While the book is targeted towards business growth and the reasons why companies tend to fail, it can be broadly applied to <em>any</em> group or organization (including software development orgs). Ask the following questions about the organization you’re contemplating joining:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What <a href=\"/img/reasons-not-to-quit-your-job/predictable.success.whole.picture.png\">stage of organizational development</a> are they in?</li>\n<li>Can I really grow the way I want to there, not just technically but also in my capacity as a human?</li>\n<li>Will the scale inhibit or promote my growth?</li>\n<li>What potential problems will exist at the new operating scale?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In my experience working as a consultant the only constant I’ve observed is that the same problems (and the same trend towards entropy) exist regardless of the scale of the company and how they use their technology.</p>\n<p>Think hard about using scale as justification for quitting your job; chances are you haven’t considered the <em>human</em> factors involved.</p>\n<h2 id=\"adversity\">Adversity</h2>\n<p>Ruling out both scale and technology as reasons for quitting a job is great, but to be honest they aren’t the most common reasons I’ve quit in the past. Typically that honor is reserved for a more sinister and damaging character-trait: an inability to handle adversity.</p>\n<p>Adversity is double-edged; it shows us the best <em>and</em> worst of ourselves, sometimes at the same time! If I take a step back and examine times when I left jobs because things just got too challenging I truly feel like there was <em>always</em> an opportunity to overcome <em>in spite of</em> the challenging situation and emerge a stronger human. How we respond to challenges in our workplace says a lot about our character:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/reasons-not-to-quit-your-job/calvin.character.building.png\" alt=\"Calvin Builds Character Shoveling Snow\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/reasons-not-to-quit-your-job/calvin.character.building.2.gif\" alt=\"Calvin Builds Character Eating Dinner\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/reasons-not-to-quit-your-job/calvin.character.building.3.gif\" alt=\"Calvin Builds Character Being Cold (and Frugal)\"></p>\n<p>Before you quit your job because it’s just “too damned hard” I would encourage you to take a moment and step outside yourself; reflect on the situation and the facts – <a href=\"https://www.vitalsmarts.com/crucialskills/2009/04/how-to-control-your-emotion/\">take the emotion out of it</a> and be objective.</p>\n<p>If you can turn a challenging situation from a painful pity-party into an opportunity to conquer and emerge better you will be amazed at what you can come through.</p>\n<h2 id=\"still-ready-to-quit\">Still Ready to Quit?</h2>\n<p>There are valid reasons to quit your job, but I think we tend to dwell on them far too often before considering the reasons <em>not</em> to. My hope for you at the end of 2016 is that as you approach the boundary and transition leading into 2017 that you would be prompted to introspect and reflect on what it is you truly want. Set some goals, list some objectives for your life and above all ask yourself some tough questions before throwing in the towel; as a wise friend of mine once said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the grass is greener on the other side, then you’d better water your own lawn.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"

Is it the right combination of <strong>vision and direction</strong> from leadership that leads to success or just simply being in the right place at the right time? All of these things are potential contributing factors to the success of a software company but none of them stand alone as reasons for success.</p>\n<p>The companies that succeed are the ones who solve their customers business problems with excellence, regardless of technology, leadership, or team composition. To attribute success to any one dimension, such as technology choice, is at best naive and at worst renders that dimension untouchable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"alignment-challenges\">Alignment Challenges</h2>\n<p>When technology is given all of the credit for success it becomes the gravitational center that all further technology decisions <em>must</em> orbit. Evaluating alternatives becomes fruitless; anything that has the potential to drift too far from the ideals of this magnetic core is viewed with skepticism. This makes it challenging for companies to adapt, or even recognize, that there are changes in technology choice that could benefit them greatly.</p>\n<p>Worse still, this magnetic core philosophy creates an environment where <em>all</em> choices are evaluated through the reality-warping magnetic field surrounding the technology core. Process changes, HR policies, culture; all these things are influenced by the gravitational pull of the core and often by the community of <em>other</em> companies who have chosen to embrace its ideals.</p>\n<h2 id=\"untouchable-icons\">Untouchable Icons</h2>\n<p>In a company where the magnetic core of technology is viewed as the sole basis for success, there become untouchable icons (the technology, and its supporters) who are unable to be challenged. This often creates a sense of fear (and paralyzes objective thinking) as any idea that deviates from core ideals is viewed as having the potential to veer the company out of orbit and cause a cascade of failure.</p>\n<p>There becomes an identity mismatch between team members who have good ideas and those who espouse core ideals; the framework of trust used to identify an individuals success often selects the latter.</p>\n<h2 id=\"technical-depth-at-the-expense-of-empathy\">Technical Depth at the expense of Empathy</h2>\n<p>Companies that align their success with the magnetic core of technology often over-value technical depth and promote from within those individuals who have demonstrated alignment with core ideals. When technical depth is put in this position of importance it creates an environment where empathy is seen as a less valuable skillset. The challenges that these companies face, and the challenges our industry continues to face are often a direct result of a commonly repeated failure that too closely aligns success with technology.</p>\n<h2 id=\"moving-forward\">Moving Forward</h2>\n<p>All of this paints a pretty bleak picture about the state of technology and the software industry and it is easy to list problems without solutions; where do we go from here? I firmly believe that there are simple solutions to the problems listed above.</p>\n<p>First, we need to balance the success equation in our companies so that it places more emphasis on <em>people</em> being the reason for success instead of technology choice.</p>\n<p>Second, We need to foster an open environment that allows people to feel like they can contribute ideas, any ideas, without feeling paralyzed by the fear of being viewed as counter-culture when ideas differ from core ideals.</p>\n<p>Lastly, and most importantly, we need to balance the framework we use to promote leaders in our companies so that empathy will be considered more important than technical depth.</p>\n"

      "content_html": "<aside class=\"tldr\">\nBuilding a framework is hard. It requires a balance between low-level primitives and higher-level abstractions.\n</aside>\n\n<p>Yehuda Katz recently gave a talk entitled <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcyxXPILO8E\">“The Future of the Client-Side\nWeb”</a> in which he detailed the\ncurrent challenges that web standards bodies face when trying to design APIs\nfor web developers to use. In this talk, Yehuda also highlighted Google’s\nrecently announced <a href=\"https://www.polymer-project.org/\">Polymer Project</a> as a good\nexample of the right way to push the web platform forward.</p>\n<p>Polymer provides a “low enough” level API that gives web developers the power\nto redefine the way they write markup using the power of newer features coming\nto JavaScript in <a href=\"https://tc39wiki.calculist.org/es6/\">ES6</a>. The specifics of\nthe implementation aren’t relevant to what I want to say here, but Yehuda does\na great job covering the details at a high level in the video; I suggest you\nwatch it if they interest you.</p>\n<p>What I found interesting was the <em>message</em> that was at the heart of the talk,\nhere’s my paraphrased version:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Web Platform standards bodies need to focus less on getting implementations\nof new APIs right the first time (hello\n<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=14702\">AppCache</a>) and instead\nprovide web developers with a set of lower level APIs that are exposed to\nJavaScript. When this approach has been followed, developers are capable of\niterating far faster than standards bodies which results in consensus on API\ndesign being reached faster and with less upfront design.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a fundamental shift in thinking that should be embraced and I believe\nthis approach has already been validated by a number of well-known JavaScript\nlibraries.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-backbone-lesson\">The Backbone Lesson</h2>\n<p>Since its release, <a href=\"https://documentcloud.github.io/backbone/\">Backbone</a> has\nexploded in popularity and many <a href=\"https://github.com/chaplinjs/chaplin\">other</a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette\">frameworks</a> have since\nbeen built on top of the low-level components it provides. <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/jashkenas\">Jeremy\nAshkenas</a> and the team at <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org\">Document\nCloud</a> did an amazing job of releasing a set of\ncomponents that can be adapted to fit almost any scenario when building a web\napplication&mdash;from simple uses of Backbone.View inside an existing legacy\napplication all the way up to writing a self-contained application that runs in\nthe browser.</p>\n<p>When I first started working in Backbone almost two years ago, I remember\nfeeling overwhelmed at how I was supposed to use all the pieces provided. I\nbelieve this speaks to the essence of how Backbone was created, and looking\nback now it is clear to me that Backbone follows the design model that Yehuda\npraises in his talk; it gave us a low-level set of components and didn’t really\nenforce any particular design decisions on how to use them&mdash;aside from an\nimportant guiding principle: get your data out of the DOM.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-ember-conundrum\">The Ember Conundrum</h2>\n<p>A recent blog post comparing <a href=\"https://emberjs.com/\">Ember</a> and\nAngular&mdash;originally entitled <a href=\"https://eviltrout.com/2013/06/15/ember-vs-angular-its-not-even-close.html\">“AngularJS vs Ember, It’s not even\nclose”</a>&mdash;highlights\nsome perceived shortcomings of Angular, chief among them being there are too\nmany pitfalls in the simplistic features Angular provides and the Angular team\nshould strive to provide higher-level conventions/components that developers\ncan follow. While Yehuda didn’t write the comparison post, the point of view\nexpressed by the author really struck me as being in stark contrast to the\ndecentralized/low-level API design approach that Yehuda extols the virtues of\nin his talk: success is realized when developers are given access to low-level\ncomponents without many opinions on how they should be used. Designing a\npowerful, approachable, easy-to-learn-difficult-to-master framework <em>is</em> hard,\nbut Ember is <em>very</em> opinionated.</p>\n<p>It seems to me like the Ember team and contributors would be better served by\nfollowing these design goals; spending more time observing how web developers\nuse their low-level APIs when crafting solutions and less time trying to get a\nhigh-level rich-web application framework right the first time. Perhaps this is\nwhy the path to Ember’s 1.0 release has been so full of frequent, <a href=\"https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/163861\">backwards\ncompatibility breaking</a> API changes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-angular-approach\">The Angular Approach</h2>\n<p>Initially I was skeptical about the power of\n<a href=\"https://www.angularjs.org\">Angular</a>, having spent a good 18 months of my life\ninvested in writing applications with Backbone I wasn’t eager to make a jump to\nanother framework. Thankfully my skepticism was quickly swept aside as I\ndiscovered the beauty in the simplicity of the Angular API. With Angular, I\ndon’t have to extend framework built-in objects or methods; I can just use\nPOJSO’s (Plain Old JavaScript Objects) and functions. I also don’t have to\nspend a lot of time thinking about how to structure my application thanks to\n<a href=\"https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/module\"><code>angular.module</code></a> and built-in\n<a href=\"https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/di\">dependency injection</a>. Angular <em>really</em>\nhits the sweet spot between low-level components and <em>tightly scoped</em>\nhigh-level abstractions. It provides high-level features that each have a\nsingular focus as well as low-level components that I can craft into\ndomain-specific solutions within my applications.</p>\n<p>The ability to craft custom markup through\n<a href=\"https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive\"><code>angular.directive</code></a> is an\ninteresting high-level piece in that it has the power to create custom\ncomponents that are as coarse or granular as you need them to be. Angular is\n<em>just</em> opinionated enough that it allows developers to work with the low-level\ncomponents provided to craft higher level abstractions. In fact, I think that\nis the core benefit of Angular. Having the power to abstract:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-xml\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">id</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;chart&quot;</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">data-type</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;bar&quot;</span>&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">class</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;legend&quot;</span>&gt;</span><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span>&gt;</span>\n  ... lots of other stuff\n<span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span>&gt;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>into</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-xml\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">bar-chart</span>&gt;</span><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">bar-chart</span>&gt;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>is an incredibly powerful idea.</p>\n<h2 id=\"web-components-and-the-future-of-markup\">Web Components and the future of Markup</h2>\n<p>One of the most exciting changes to the Web Platform in the last five years is\nthe upcoming <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-components-intro-20130606/\">Web\nComponents</a> spec.\n<a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CC0QFjAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Febidel&amp;ei=_EDLUbuIK8iHywGUuYHoDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHgffvpgL9vHcpCK96uvkRqTmUkzg&amp;bvm=bv.48340889,d.aWc\">Eric\nBidelman</a>\ngave a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqULJBBEVQE\">great overview</a> of it\nduring Google IO this year and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jkomoros\">Alex Komoroske</a>\nand <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattsmcnulty\">Matthew McNulty</a> had an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g0oOOT86NY\">amazing\ndemo</a> that showcased some of the\ncapabilities. I’m excited about Web Components because it will allow web\ndevelopers to experiment at a lower-level by reshaping the way that we write\nmarkup. It will also offer true encapsulation on the web, a feature that has\nbeen sorely lacking.</p>\n<p>It seems like the lessons the Angular team have learned are helping to shape\nthe direction of Web Components. In fact, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mhevery\">Miško\nHevery</a> from the Angular team has <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/polymer-dev/4RSYaKmbtEk/uYnY3900wpIJ\">this to\nsay</a>\non Angular + Web Components:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Web Components (Polymer, Ember, or any other framework/library) will work\n seamlessly within Angular apps and directives.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Components written in Angular will export to Web Components (to be used by\n Polymer, Ember, or any other framework/library).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The awesome thing about Angular and Polymer is that you can use them to achieve\nthese kinds of markup abstractions in your applications right now, along with\nall the other great features they provide. I’m eager to see how the lower-level\nfeatures in ES6 and low-level libraries like Polymer are going to be used by\ndevelopers to create even more amazing frameworks in the future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"moving-the-web-forward-with-low-level-apis\">Moving the Web Forward with Low-Level APIs</h2>\n<p>I think Yehuda has it right; standards bodies need to focus less on getting\nhigh-level APIs right up front and more on providing developers with enough\nlow-level APIs with which to experiment. The same principle applies to the\ndesign of JavaScript application frameworks. My hope is that the standards\nbodies <em>and</em> JavaScript framework authors embrace this decentralized approach\nto design going forward. Ideally this will move the web development community\nbeyond rhetoric and zero-sum thinking, and into an age of innovation.</p>\n"
